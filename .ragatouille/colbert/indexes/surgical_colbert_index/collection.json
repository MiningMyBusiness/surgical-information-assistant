These \npatients, predominantly young and male, present \nafter traumatic events such as motor vehicle \ncollisions and falls. A spinal column injury might be \none aspect of poly-trauma and its management must \nbe prioritized as soon as cardiopulmonary stability is \nachieved.  \nCurrent understanding of spinal cord injury \nrecognizes both the primary injury (the trauma itself) \nand the secondary injury (damage occurring after the \ntrauma itself). Primary spinal cord injury is the initial \ndamage done to the spinal cord, most commonly due \nto physical, traumatic stress. Secondary spinal cord \ninjury is understood to occur from the delayed and \nharmful inflammatory response that can itself cause \nfurther neurological damage.",
  "Primary spinal cord injury is the initial \ndamage done to the spinal cord, most commonly due \nto physical, traumatic stress. Secondary spinal cord \ninjury is understood to occur from the delayed and \nharmful inflammatory response that can itself cause \nfurther neurological damage. Decades of research \nhave sought to block this cascade, though sadly no \ndefinitive treatment has been found. High-dose \nsteroid protocols have helped in occasional \nsituations, though clinical trials have largely \nremained disappointing. Steroid use is no longer \nstandard for spinal cord injuries in most management \nguidelines.  \nPrimary spinal cord injuries might result \nfrom impact, laceration, hyper-flexion or -extension, \nor ongoing compression.

While you are \nlearning this operation, take notes on each procedure \nyou do and track your patency rate. This will allow \nyou to refine your technique.  \nBrachial-Cephalic fistula formation proceeds in \nthe following steps:  \n\u25cf Careful evaluation of the patient\u2019s superficial \nvenous and arterial systems and marking of the \nplanned surgical site.  \n\u25cf Incision, exposure, and dissection of the cephalic \nvein \n\u25cf Exposure of the brachial artery \n\u25cf Confirmation that the vein will reach the artery \nand further mobilization if necessary \n\u25cf Systemic administration of heparin and clamping \nof vessels \n\u25cf Tailoring of the artery and vein for anastomosis \n\u25cf Anastomosis \n\u25cf Confirmation of patency and closure \n \nSteps: \n1.",
  "The venous and arterial system must be evaluated \ncarefully. Vein(s) and the arterial pulsation are \nmarked and the planned incision is indicated. \nLocal anesthetic with epinephrine is infiltrated \nintradermally only, to avoid the possibility of \ninjury to the vein, which may be very superficial \nat this point.  \n \nThe right antecubital fossa has been examined and marked. The \nupper arm and shoulder are up in the photo. The line shown by \nthe Blue arrow indicates the cephalic vein, which is visible and \npalpable after application of the phlebotomy tourniquet. This \nvein often extends laterally as it runs in a cranial direction, \nupwards and towards the left in this photo. The line shown by \nthe Red arrow is the brachial artery location, as assessed by \npalpation. This is just medial to the biceps tendon, which is also \npalpable in the antecubital fossa.",

Surgery may be delayed or deferred in such \npatients. Special attention should be paid, in large \nhernias, to the possibility of loss of domain. In this \ncondition, a large hernia has been present for so long \nthat the visceral cavity no longer has the size to \naccommodate return of all abdominal contents after \nrepair of the hernia. Returning the contents of the \nhernia to the abdominal cavity, if that is even \npossible, will lead to respiratory embarrassment, \nexcessive tension on the repair, and even abdominal \ncompartment syndrome.  \n \nAnatomy:  \n \nThe arcuate line is a horizontal line located 2-5cm below the \numbilicus.",

In these situations, it is necessary to \nincise the shortened muscles, or to place a prosthetic \nmesh, or ideally to do both. Closure of a wound with \nmesh distributes the tension of the wound across a \nlarger area than simple closure.  \nPlacement of a mesh increases the risk of \ncomplications, which is acceptable because of the \ndecrease in risk of recurrence.

  "Onlay (Yellow): Mesh is placed by clearing off the \nanterior rectus sheath, closing the defect primarily, \nand securing the mesh.  \nInlay (Red): Mesh is used to bridge a defect that \ncannot be closed; the mesh is sutured to the edges of \nthe fascia.  \nSublay (Purple): Mesh is placed in between the \nrectus muscle and the posterior rectus sheath. Also \nknown as Retro-rectus placement, or the Rives-\nStoppa technique. \nUnderlay (Green): Mesh is placed within the \nperitoneal cavity, in contact with bowel. Also known \nas Intraperitoneal Onlay Mesh, IPOM.

In our setting, without expertise in \nendoscopic intervention and with limited equipment, \nwe make one attempt at endoscopic intervention and \nthen proceed with laparotomy. Most in resource-\nlimited settings do not have the ability to inject \nepinephrine around an ulcer, apply a heater probe, or \nclip exposed vessels endoscopically.

  "In this case, \nendoscopy is used only to determine the location of \nthe bleeding: treatment will either be surgical or \nconservative with high dose proton-pump inhibitors. \nIt is much easier to localize the site of bleeding at \nendoscopy than at open surgery; we describe how to \napproach this scenario without an endoscope, if you \nhave to, in the \u201cApproach\u201d chapter cited above.  \nBleeding gastric ulcers are better treated with \nresection if the patient is stable, because of the risk \nof malignancy and also to decrease the risk of future \nbleeding.

  "The complications are few, but definite. \nMoreover, adoption of conventional laparoscopic \nsurgery in low resource settings is complex and takes \na longer time to set up. \nIn \nhigh-resource \nsettings, \ngasless \nlaparoscopic \nsurgeries, \nalso \ncalled \nisobaric \nlaparoscopic surgeries, became popular in the 1990s, \nin an attempt to mitigate the problems associated \nwith gas insufflation. However, the early equipment \noffered less than optimal exposure due to tenting, and \nthe design was clunky. Hence most of the \npublications were from single centre experiences, \nalthough these indicated a potential usefulness of the \nmodality. The Gas Insufflation-Less Laparoscopic \nSurgeries (GILLS) was adopted by rural surgeons in \nlow-resource settings primarily because of the \nfollowing advantages: \n1. GILLS is less expensive and can be \nperformed using the readily available spinal \nanaesthesia in rural areas \n2. Overall costs are lower compared with open \nsurgery \nor \nconventional \nlaparoscopic \nprocedures \n3.",

  "The outcomes for \nGILLS were better when compared to open \nabdominal surgeries. Moreover, single incision \nlaparoscopic surgeries are more straightforward and \nless expensive with GILLS.  \nGILLS creates space for surgery by lifting \nhalf of the abdominal wall with a specially designed \nring inserted through the umbilical incision. The \npatient is positioned so that the intestines move away \nfrom the operating field due to gravity. For example, \na steep lithotomy position is used for pelvic surgeries \nalong with a shoulder brace that prevents the patient \nfrom sliding down.  \nAn umbilical incision is used to insert the ring \nand to pass the laparoscope and instruments.

  "The \nfocus becomes on controlling the bleeding or \neliminating the source of sepsis and getting the \npatient to the ICU for further resuscitation and \nrewarming. Especially with hemorrhagic shock, you \nmust get out of the operating room before the \u201clethal \ntriad\u201d \nsets \nin: \nhypothermia, \nacidosis, \nand \ncoagulopathy.   \nIn other situations, the patient\u2019s condition \ndeteriorates unexpectedly in the middle of a \nlaparotomy, due to acute myocardial infarction, \npulmonary \nembolism, \nor \nrarely, \nmalignant \nhyperthermia. \nWhen \nthe \npatient\u2019s \ncondition \ndeteriorates, this type of closure helps you get the \npatient out of the operating room much faster.  \n \nAlternatively, sometimes it is an intra-\nabdominal condition that prevents you from closing \nthe \nabdomen. \nOne \nexample \nis \nabdominal \ncompartment \nsyndrome. \nThe \nintra-abdominal \ncontents will not fit into the space that would remain \nafter closure, due to edema.",

Delays longer than 72hours, and certainly \nlonger than a week, greatly increase the risk of failure \nto achieve primary fascial closure during the index \nadmission.

  "Gastrostomy is contraindicated in patients \nwith obstruction of the pylorus or duodenum, or \nfunctional \nproblems \ndownstream \nsuch \nas \nanastomotic leakage in the small intestine. Such \npatients are better served by a jejunostomy. However \njejunostomy is much more difficult to manage, \nrequiring continuous rather than bolus infusion, and \nbeing more vulnerable to blockage of the smaller-\ncaliber tube.  \n \nPercutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) \nusing a flexible fiberoptic gastroscope avoids \nlaparotomy for tube placement, but requires \nspecialized equipment as well as a non-obstructed \nupper gastrointestinal tract to allow passage of the \nscope. This procedure is discussed in a separate \nchapter.  \n \nBoth open and percutaneous gastrostomy \nmake a hole in the stomach. After 5-7 days (but more \nreliably after 2 weeks) a tract is formed between the \nskin and the stomach. After that time, the tube can be \nchanged if needed, or simply replaced if it falls out.",
  "After 5-7 days (but more \nreliably after 2 weeks) a tract is formed between the \nskin and the stomach. After that time, the tube can be \nchanged if needed, or simply replaced if it falls out. \nIf the tube becomes dislodged before 5-7 days post \nsurgery, a repeat laparotomy may be required. In case \nof dislodgement of a recently placed tube, after the \ntube is returned to place, a contrast study should be \nused to confirm its position in the stomach. If the \ntube passes easily into the stomach when replaced \nand the operation was more than 2 weeks previous, a \ncontrast study is not necessary.   \n \nA variety of tubes can be used in resource-\nlimited settings, including Foley catheters, Malecot \ncatheters, and dedicated gastrostomy tubes. Foley \ncatheters are very common and are often used for \ngastrostomy, however the balloon must not be \nallowed to migrate across the pylorus or it will cause \nbowel obstruction.",
  "Foley \ncatheters are very common and are often used for \ngastrostomy, however the balloon must not be \nallowed to migrate across the pylorus or it will cause \nbowel obstruction. The problem with using a foley \ncatheter for a gastrostomy is that it will forever be \nprone to either falling out if the balloon is not \ninflated, or migrating to the gastric outlet and causing \nobstruction if the balloon is inflated. The solution to \nboth problems is to make sure it is well secured to \nthe abdominal skin.  \n \nCommercially available gastrostomy tubes have a balloon at \nthe tip (Black Arrow) and a flange (Red Arrow) that can be slid \nalong the tube. After placement of the tube, the flange is slid \ndistally so that the gastric and abdominal wall are squeezed \ngently together by the inflated balloon on the inside, and the \nflange on the outside.",
  "After placement of the tube, the flange is slid \ndistally so that the gastric and abdominal wall are squeezed \ngently together by the inflated balloon on the inside, and the \nflange on the outside.  \n \n \nIn general, the steps of open gastrostomy \nplacement are:  \n\u25cf Mini-laparotomy \n\u25cf Selection of the tube placement site \n\u25cf Mobilization of the stomach into the surgical \nfield \n\u25cf Placement of two purse-string sutures \n\u25cf Passage of the gastrostomy tube through the \nabdominal wall \n\u25cf Gastrotomy and passage of the tube into the \nstomach lumen \n\u25cf Closure of the purse-string sutures \n\u25cf Securing the anterior stomach to the abdominal \nwall \n\u25cf Fascial and skin closure.  \n \nSteps: \n1. The clinical status of the patient as indication for \ngastrostomy tube placement is quite enough \nmost of the time, but in case of esophageal \nobstructive tumor, an OGD should be done if \nnot done previously to rule out the possibility of \na PEG tube placement vs open.    \n2.

  "The \ndiagnosis of compartment syndrome is largely \nclinical, but measurement of compartment pressures \nmay be useful in patients with equivocal findings or \naltered level of consciousness. The below- knee \nlower extremity is most commonly affected, \nfollowed much less frequently, by the forearm, thigh, \nbuttock, foot and hand  \n \nPathophysiology/Epidemiology: \nCompartment syndrome has been found \nwherever a compartment is present: hand, forearm, \nupper arm, abdomen, buttock and the entire lower \nextremity. The pathophysiology of compartment \nsyndrome is relatively straightforward. Groups of \nmuscles and their associated nerves and vessels are \nsurrounded by thick fascial layers that define the \nvarious compartments of the extremities. These \ncompartments are of relatively fixed volume, as the \nfascial layers are unable to expand. Compartment \nsyndrome occurs either when compartment size is \nrestricted or compartment volume is increased. This \ncan occur because of fractures, vascular injuries, \nelectrical burns, blast injuries, crush injuries, too \ntight casts of splints, or tissue trauma after fracture \nreduction.",

This \ncan occur because of fractures, vascular injuries, \nelectrical burns, blast injuries, crush injuries, too \ntight casts of splints, or tissue trauma after fracture \nreduction. \nAs the pressure within the compartment \n(from blood, fluid, or external pressure) increases, \nthe \ntissue \nperfusion \ndecreases \nand \ncellular \nmetabolism is impaired, leading to cellular death. If \nthis pressure is not relieved in a timely fashion, \nirreversible damage will occur. The usually quoted \ntime is 4 to 6 hours, but it may be as little as an hour \nfor a patient in shock. Polytrauma patients with \nhypotension can sustain irreversible injury at lower \ncompartment pressures than normotensive patients, \nand a very high index of suspicion should be \nmaintained in this group. \nThe leg (calf) is the area that is most \ncommonly affected, accounting for 68% in a large \ncivilian series (Branco), followed by the forearm \n(14%), and the thigh (9%).",

  "Physics: \nThe Piezoelectric Effect:  \nQuartz is a solid made of Silicone and \nOxygen molecules in a highly ordered structure. \nUltrasound transducers contain a quartz crystal. \nAccording to the Piezoelectric effect, when \nelectricity passes through a crystal it causes the \ncrystal to vibrate.

First, the ultrasound \nwaves are generated: electrical energy is applied to \nthe crystal and converted to high frequency \nsoundwaves, which  enter enter the tissue below the \ntransducer. These soundwaves interact with the \ntissue, and then are reflected back towards the \ntransducer at different frequencies, based on the \ncharacteristics of the tissue.",
  "These soundwaves interact with the \ntissue, and then are reflected back towards the \ntransducer at different frequencies, based on the \ncharacteristics of the tissue. When these sound waves \nreturn, they interact with the same crystal. Here \nagain, mechanical energy is converted to electrical \nenergy, this time containing information about the \ntissue it has been reflected from. This energy is then \nconverted to an image. \nThe sound waves emitted by the crystal are in \nthe range of 2-10 Megahertz (mHz, millions of \ncycles per second.) By comparison, human hearing \noccurs at 20Hz to 20kHz. \nThe tissue below the probe reflects the sound \nwaves differently based on its characteristics. The \nmore dense a tissue is, the more \u201cbright\u201d it appears \non the screen. Therefore, the image on the screen is \na reflection of the amount of time a sound wave takes \nto return to the transducer (depth of the structure) and \nthe strength of the sound wave (brightness of the \nimage.)",

The vibrations are transformed into electrical \nsignals, which are reconstructed to make a two dimensional \n(depth and width) image. \n \nAnatomy: \nAcoustic Shadowing: \nSome tissue does not allow sound to pass \nthrough it at all.

  "Regarding the first \nstage, remember that a leaking intestine inside the \nabdomen will leak into the peritoneum before finding \nits way to the skin. Sepsis control consists of draining \nthe peritoneum and assuring a consistent exit of the \nleakage. Usually this will involve re-opening the \nabdominal incision, or making a new opening over \nthe leaking site, and not closing it. This results in the \ndreaded \u201copen abdomen.\u201d We discuss this entity here \nas well.  \n \nThe best possible outcome for a fistula is for \nit to close on its own.

Although \nthis approach might be needed with very proximal \nfistulas, in most situations there are other options that \ncost less money and allow a patient to experience the \njoy of eating. In any event, in a resource-limited \nsetting, prolonged hospitalization and parenteral \nnutrition are not realistic options.  \n \nAnatomy:  \nThe lateral abdominal wall muscles originate \nat the posterior aspect of the abdominal cavity, along \nthe lumbodorsal fascia and other midline posterior \nstructures.

As a \ngeneral rule of thumb, if the patient had an \nuncomplicated laparotomy, you should not attempt \nto operate in their abdomen during the time period of \n2-6 weeks after surgery. If there was spillage of \nsuccus or infection, do not operate for at least 3 \nmonths: 6 months would be preferable.

This is why most surgeons \nrecommend avoiding operation for 3-6 months after \nintraperitoneal spillage. But the surgeon should also \ndo their best to prevent this fluid from coming in \ncontact with the skin. Once the skin is irritated, it will \nbe painful to the patient and much more difficult to \napply dressings or ostomy appliances to. One \ncommon mistake is cutting the hole in the ostomy \nappliance too big: it must be trimmed to almost \nexactly the size of the exposed mucosa or wound. \nPeri-wound or peristomal skin excoriation is much \nbetter avoided than treated, as we describe further \nbelow.  \n \nAn ostomy appliance that has been cut too large exposes the \nskin to enteric contents (within solid Red circle) which can \ncause irritation over time. It would be better to cut the \nappliance to just a little smaller than the ostomy (dashed Red \ncircle.)",

Greater than all of these, and \naccompanying many of them, is malnutrition.

This \nwill almost always be an indication to return to the \noperating room for closure, except in those situations \ndescribed below.  \nIf you do not make the diagnosis at this stage, \nthe problem will most likely present itself in a more \ndramatic fashion. During mobilization or a cough, \nthe wound suddenly bursts open and the intestines \nappear, sometimes protruding from the abdomen. In \nthis case, surgical re-exploration is mandatory and \nmust be done very soon.  \n \nSometimes fascial dehiscence accompanies \nan intra-abdominal infection, either an abscess or an \nanastomotic leak.

Approximately 7.59 \nmillion people worldwide experienced a documented \nskull fracture in 2019, with an incidence of \napproximately 98.9 per 100,000 population annually. \nDepressed skull fractures are fractures of the cranial \nvault in which the edges of the bone fragments are \ndisplaced from one another and one fragment is \ndepressed into the intracranial space, altering the \nnatural curvature of the calvarium. A skull fracture is \nnot considered significantly depressed unless the \nfragment is displaced at least the width of the bone.",
  "A skull fracture is \nnot considered significantly depressed unless the \nfragment is displaced at least the width of the bone. \nThis condition can be seen on imaging when the \nouter table of the depressed fragment is in line with, \nor deeper than, the inner table of the adjacent \nunfractured skull.  \n \n \n \nAxial (Top) and sagittal (Bottom) CT scan demonstrating a \ndepressed frontal bone fracture.

If the fracture \nwas open with significant dirt and debris or if \nthere are several small fragments, the flap may be \ndiscarded with future plans to replace it. This \noption may reduce the risk of infection after \ncranioplasty if the fracture was open and overtly \ncontaminated \nand \nmay \nresult \nin \nbetter \ncranioplasty contour if the fracture was heavily \nfragmented. Alternatively, if the fracture was not \nopen or fragmented, common practice is to save \nthe elevated bone flap for future replacement, \neither in a designated tissue fridge if available or \nin the subcutaneous space in the abdomen if it is \nnot. These decisions are more complicated in \nresource-limited settings, where alloplastic \nmaterials such as bone cement and titanium mesh \nare often not available.  \n17.

It is especially important to identify \nsystem issues- improving these can have a dramatic \neffect on patient safety. The truth is, most adverse \nevents are due to systems issues rather than \nindividual poor judgment. Examples include failure \nto act on abnormal vital signs and recognize a \ndeteriorating patient, or malfunction of crucial \nequipment during an emergency. These must be \naddressed through a root cause analysis and \ncorrection of the system factors that caused the \ncomplication (see \u201cQuality Improvement.\u201d) This \nprocess depends on a well-conducted audit.  \nDuring the audit, be open and honest about \nwhat happened.

  "Intraoperative identification can be difficult, \ngiven the sometimes subtle appearance of a ureteral \ninjury. In these cases, the collecting system can be \npressurized by injecting saline or methylene blue \ndirectly into the ureter or renal pelvis, to help identify \nextravasation.

Alternatively, if the ureter cannot \nbe identified due to surrounding tissue damage and a \ncystoscope is available, canalization of the distal \nureter endoscopically with injection of saline or \nmethylene blue may help identify the distal extent of \nthe injury. \n \nAnatomy:  \nThe ureter originates from the renal pelvis at \nthe ureteropelvic junction, just distal and posterior to \nthe renal hilum.

  "The ureter is divided into three sections based on \nvascular supply. The proximal ureter is fed by the \nrenal artery; the mid ureter has a variable supply \nincluding the gonadal vessels, aorta, and the iliac \nvessels; and the distal ureter relies on supply from the \nsuperior and inferior vesical arteries off the internal \niliac. These larger arteries feed subsequently smaller \nbranches which anastomose within the fibrous \nadventitia of the ureter along its entire length. \nTherefore, while loss of any single large vessel will \nnot necessarily devitalize the entire ureter, careful \ntissue handling of the ureter and its adventitia is \nessential to avoid damage to these small vessels. The \nsmall caliber of the periureteral vascular arcades also \nrequires ureteral anastomoses to be done in a tension-\nfree manner to maintain uncompromised flow \nthough those vessels.",

The fibrous adventitia \nhouses the microvasculature of the ureter along its entire \nlength. It is essential to appose the mucosal layer in a watertight \nclosure.  \n \nWithin the adventitia is the smooth muscle of \nthe ureter, lined by urothelial mucosa. It is paramount \nthat any ureteral repair, whether primary or via \nreimplantation, includes circumferential mucosa-to-\nmucosa apposition. Failing to ensure this critical step \nleads to urine leakage and periureteral scaring, \nfibrosis and stricture formation.",
  "Failing to ensure this critical step \nleads to urine leakage and periureteral scaring, \nfibrosis and stricture formation. \n \nPrinciples of Ureteral Repair: \nThe success of open ureteral repair is dictated \nby five principles: \n \n1. Selection of the appropriate repair: \n \nRepair selection should be based on patient \nstability, injury etiology and location of the injury. \nThis is due to the wide variability of patient \npresentations (stable vs. unstable), vascular supply \nalong the length of the ureter (proximal, middle and \ndistal) and the time needed to perform different \nrepairs (stenting, primary repair and bladder \nreimplant). \n \n2. Minimizing ureteral dissection: \n \nAs larger vessels feed the ureter via a network \nof small periureteral vessels within the ureteral \nadventitia, overly aggressive dissection can result in \ndisruption of the vascular supply needed to feed the \nhealing anastomosis.",
  "Thus, ureteral dissection and \ndebridement should be done judiciously with the \ngoal of removing any devitalized tissue and \nmobilizing the ureter no more than is needed for a \ntension-free, spatulated anastomosis. \n \n3. Mucosa-to-mucosa apposition: \n \nMucosal apposition facilitates a watertight \nclosure and resultant healing. Direct contact between \nurothelial mucosa and ureteral smooth muscle or \nadventitia leads to fibrosis and scarring with resultant \nureteral stricture formation. Furthermore, leakage of \nurine from the repair can lead to a similar fibrosis as \nwell as fluid collections and abscesses that put the \npatient at risk for infection and complicate future \nattempts at repair. \n \n4.",

Adequate upper tract drainage: \n \nMaintaining a low pressure upper urinary \ntract following ureteral repair minimizes the \nopportunity for urine to leak from suture lines, \noptimizing tissue healing.",
  "5. Adequate upper tract drainage: \n \nMaintaining a low pressure upper urinary \ntract following ureteral repair minimizes the \nopportunity for urine to leak from suture lines, \noptimizing tissue healing. This should be done, at a \nminimum, with a ureteral stent and can be augmented \nwith a foley catheter to reduce urine reflux along the \nstent. Add a nephrostomy tube for proximal \ndecompression when a repair is considered at high \nrisk of failing. In settings where a ureteral stent is not \navailable, ureteral repair without a stent can be \nperformed; however, there is likely a higher risk of \nleak and/or stricture formation. If upper tract \ndrainage is not available with either a nephrostomy \ntube or a stent, we would recommend extended \nretroperitoneal drainage with a closed suction drain \nto minimize risk of urinoma formation and infection. \n \nDecision Making: \nThe Unstable Patient: \nThe first consideration in evaluating a \nureteral injury is patient stability.",
  "Decision Making: \nThe Unstable Patient: \nThe first consideration in evaluating a \nureteral injury is patient stability. For unstable \npatients with a partial ureteral injury, a ureteral stent \ncan be placed with the understanding that \nreconstruction can be considered when the patient is \nno longer critical. For complete ureteral disruptions \nin the unstable patient, the proximal ureter should be \nclipped or tied off just proximal to the injury, and a \nnephrostomy tube can be placed. When nephrostomy \ntube placement is not feasible or available, drainage \nmay be achieved in one of two ways. First, the \nproximal ureter can be brought to the skin and \nmatured as a cutaneous ureterostomy, ideally with an \nindwelling stent. Alternatively, a single-J or double-\nJ stent can be placed into the proximal ureter and \nrenal pelvis and secured with a non-absorbable \nsuture, with the other end then brought through the \nskin as a drain to allow temporary urinary drainage.",
  "Alternatively, a single-J or double-\nJ stent can be placed into the proximal ureter and \nrenal pelvis and secured with a non-absorbable \nsuture, with the other end then brought through the \nskin as a drain to allow temporary urinary drainage. \nFinally, if patient stability does not allow for even \nthese maneuvers, ureteral injuries can be left in situ \nfor a short term (1-2 days), preferably with a \ntemporary abdominal vacuum closure, as the \nmajority of urine will be removed via suction (See \nTemporary Abdominal Closure.) \n \nThe Stable Patient \nFor the stable patient, ureteral injuries should \nbe repaired at the time of identification whenever \npossible. In general, other intra-abdominal injuries \nshould not preclude reconstruction for the stable \npatient. However, long mid-to-proximal ureteral \ninjuries that would require extensive reconstruction, \nsuch as a creation of an ileal ureter, are generally not \npreferable in the acute setting and should be \npostponed for a later procedure.  \nAs previously stated, the location of the \ninjury guides the repair.",
  "As previously stated, the location of the \ninjury guides the repair. Distal injuries are best \nreimplanted into the bladder due to the detrusor \nmuscle\u2019s robust blood supply from the bilateral \nsuperior and inferior vesical arteries. This blood \nsupply also directly feeds the distal ureter and is ideal \nfor anastomotic healing and responsible for the low \nrate of ureteroneocystostomy strictures. The bladder \ncan be mobilized using a psoas hitch with or without \na Boari flap in order to bridge the gap to healthy \nureter. These strategies can make even mid-ureteral \ninjuries re-implantable into the bladder. For injuries \nthat are too proximal for even aggressive bladder \nmobilization \nand \nreconstruction, \nuretero-\nureterostomy should be performed. Regardless of the \ninjury location, a ureteral stent should be placed \nacross repairs when available and a closed-suction \ndrain left in the abdomen.",
  "Regardless of the \ninjury location, a ureteral stent should be placed \nacross repairs when available and a closed-suction \ndrain left in the abdomen. \n \nThe decision to debride ureteral tissue prior \nto repair can be difficult considering the sometimes \ncompeting goals of a tension free anastomosis and \nminimal ureteral dissection. Injury etiology should \nalso be considered. The extent of injuries due to high-\nvelocity weapons may not be fully apparent at the \ntime of the operation. In such situations, we \nrecommend slightly more extensive debridement \nprior to repair to ensure the health of tissue to be \nincorporated. These injuries include blasts, hunting \nor \nmilitary-style \nrifles, \nand \nhigh-energy \nelectrocautery injuries.

For most \nincomplete injuries, where extravasation is present \nbut contrast traverses the injury, a stent should be \nplaced. This stent should be left in place for at least \n6 weeks with a foley catheter remaining for at least 1 \nweek. \nFor complete injuries, where contrast does \nnot traverse the area of extravasation, or in cases \nwhen the patient will be taken back to the operating \nroom for other injuries, open surgical repair should \nbe attempted using the techniques outlined above. \nSuch repairs are best done within 7 to 10 days from \nthe initial injury.

These include the face and scalp and \nacross joints. \nThe main limitation of full thickness skin \ngrafts is the size: skin must be taken from places \nwhere it is \u201credundant.\u201d When you remove full \nthickness skin you must leave enough behind to still \nclose the wound. Areas where this can be done \ninclude the lower neck, the groin, the posterior \naxillary fold, and the abdomen. For small grafts on \nthe head or face, the skin behind the ear is color-\nmatched and hairless.  \n \nFull thickness skin grafts contract much less \nthan split thickness grafts do, so they are commonly \nused in sensitive areas of the face.",
  "For small grafts on \nthe head or face, the skin behind the ear is color-\nmatched and hairless.  \n \nFull thickness skin grafts contract much less \nthan split thickness grafts do, so they are commonly \nused in sensitive areas of the face. For example, in a \nlarge facial burn it would be appropriate to use split \nthickness skin (not meshed) on most of the face, but \nthe eyelids would be better treated with a full \nthickness graft.  \n \nFull thickness grafts can be used for burn \ncontracture reconstruction, though they are more \nlikely than flaps to cause recurrent contracture with \nthis application. Many practitioners will splint a joint \nfor a period of 3-6 months after contracture release \nand full thickness graft reconstruction.  \n \nIn head and neck reconstruction, skin for \ngrafting is often chosen from the neck because this \narea has had the same sun exposure as the head, so \nthe color match of the graft will be better. This is less \nof an issue in people with very dark skin, however.  \n \nOne other consideration is whether the donor \nsite bears hair, and whether hair is appropriate at the \nrecipient site.",
  "This is less \nof an issue in people with very dark skin, however.  \n \nOne other consideration is whether the donor \nsite bears hair, and whether hair is appropriate at the \nrecipient site. Most people would not want hair \ngrowing on their forehead, or on the inside of their \nmouth. And if hair-bearing skin is used as a for \nurethral reconstruction, either as a flap or a graft, the \nhair follicles can act as a nidus for stone formation.  \n \nClosure of defects after head and neck tumor \nexcision is a complex subject. In some cases, a flap \nwill be better suited than a graft, especially in a hair-\nbearing part of the scalp.

However, fractures of the facial \nskeleton rarely exist without facial lacerations of \nsome kind. These are addressed in a separate chapter; \nrealistically you will be addressing both at the same \ntime.  \nPatients with both mandibular and maxillary \nfractures are especially challenging- it can be \ndifficult to restore dental occlusion, and the danger \nof palate fistula or other complications is higher.

It is common practice to empirically \nimmobilize the patient\u2019s cervical spine with a soft but \nrigid collar (\u201cPhiladelphia\u201d) until cervical spine \ninjury has been ruled out.  \nHere, we discuss the relevant anatomy and \ndiagnostic maneuvers to classify a midface fracture. \nEach separate operation is then considered in its own \nchapter.  \n \nAnatomy:  \nThe skin and nerves, lips, salivary glands and \nducts are considered in the chapter on facial \nlacerations and injuries. Lacerations of the eyelids \nare considered in their own chapter. The globe and \norbit are so inter-related that they will both be \nconsidered here. \nWhen evaluating patients with facial injuries, \nit is crucial to understand the anatomy of the maxilla, \nzygoma, naso-orbito-ethmoid complex and the \njunction of these with the frontal bones.",
  "When evaluating patients with facial injuries, \nit is crucial to understand the anatomy of the maxilla, \nzygoma, naso-orbito-ethmoid complex and the \njunction of these with the frontal bones.  \nThe midface can be conceptually pictured as \na series of pillars, providing support and resisting \ninjury, with very thin-walled spaces in between, \nfilled with air or vital structures.  \nThe largest air-filled space is the maxillary \nsinus. Its anterior and superior walls are paper-thin \nproviding little structural support. The anterior \naspects of its medial and lateral walls, on the other \nhand, are quite thick and serve to connect the hard \npalate and the upper teeth to the rest of the midface.  \n \nThe maxillary sinuses (Light Blue) are air-filled spaces in the \nmidface. Their anterior walls (including the foramena of the \ninfraorbital nerves) and inferior walls (the orbital floors) are \nmade of very thin bone which provides little structural support. \nThe thickened portions of the zygoma (surrounded by dotted \nlines) are very thick: fractures rarely pass through these areas.",
  "The thickened portions of the zygoma (surrounded by dotted \nlines) are very thick: fractures rarely pass through these areas. \n \n \nKeeping the maxillary sinuses in mind, we \ncan think of a series of \u201cpillars\u201d in the intact midface \nwhere the structural support is strongest. Fractures \ncommonly pass through these areas. They are also \ncalled \u201cbuttresses,\u201d after the support structures of a \nbuilding. Understanding where these buttresses are \nlocated allows us to communicate types of fractures, \nplan management, and to anticipate complications.  \n \nThe buttresses of the midface, anterior view.

In the UK, the incision was popularized by \nMonroe Kerr, who first used it in 1911, so in English-\nspeaking countries it is sometimes called the Kerr \nincision or the Pfannenstiel\u2013Kerr incision. Today, \nthe Pfannenstiel incision is the most used incision for \nCaesarian Birth as well as urologic, orthopedic, and \npelvic procedures.",
  "Today, \nthe Pfannenstiel incision is the most used incision for \nCaesarian Birth as well as urologic, orthopedic, and \npelvic procedures. For urologic procedures such as \nSuprapubic Prostatectomy or in some instances of \nUreter Replantation, the incision is placed low \nenough to allow the surgeon to remain outside the \nperitoneum, in the prevesical (extraperitoneal) space, \nas described further below.  \nThe major drawback of this incision is its \nlimited exposure beyond the pelvis: if a patient\u2019s \nintra-abdominal pathology is unknown, a vertical \nmidline incision is more appropriate.  \nBlood supply in the area includes the inferior \nepigastric vessels, which lie posterior to the rectus \nmuscles, moving more laterally towards the external \niliac vessels as they proceed into the pelvis. The \nsuperficial epigastric vessels are found just below the \nskin- when the incision is very wide, they must be \ndealt with during the skin incision to prevent \ntroublesome bleeding.",

Complications include metabolic \nchanges, impaired drug metabolism, cardiovascular \nchanges, effects on coagulation, etc. Patients under \ngeneral anesthesia will typically lose 0.5\u00baC to 1.5\u00baC \nwithin the first hour as a result of vasodilation and \nredistribution of body heat. Most of the body\u2019s heat \nloss happens at the skin level in the form of radiation; \nhowever, convective, conductive, and evaporative \nmodalities can further lead to heat loss in a patient. \nWarming devices can be used to maintain \nnormothermia in a patient if they meet the following \nstandards.",

  "Commentary: Hot water bottles are a very cheap way \nto provide heat to patients.  Latex gloves can also be \nfilled with warm water.  Sterilization should have a \nhot water source that can be used for this.  A broken \nrefrigerator is an excellent way to warm blankets and \ngowns for patients by installing light bulbs inside the \nrefrigerator along with a thermostat (for a \nterrarium, for example.)   \nIt is important to test any water with your \nown hand before placing it on a patient\u2019s skin, as \nanesthetized patients will not be able to tell you that \nthey are being burned by something that is intended \nto warm them.

Therefore, the operating theater should \nmaintain negative pressure, thereby preventing \nairflow out to the hall or other operating theaters. \nAdditionally, the flow of fresh air into the theater \nshould allow for six to ten total air exchanges each \nhour. This circulation can be achieved by exhausting \nthe operating room air outside or recirculating it \nthrough a filtered system. \n \nCommentary: When forced air ventilation is not \nfeasible, keeping some doors and windows open is an \neasy way to get air exchange.

New equipment must be \npurchased, learned about, and maintained. New \nprocedures will be billed differently.",
  "Becoming facile at laparoscopic surgery \ntakes time and commitment, both on the part of the \nsurgeon and the hospital. New equipment must be \npurchased, learned about, and maintained. New \nprocedures will be billed differently. The equipment \nis more complex and prone to breakage and \nmalfunction, especially if mishandled. The surgeon \nis well advised to seek a mentor and perform \nlaparoscopic surgery under supervision as much as \npossible before starting to practice it alone.  \n \nThere are a number of complications \nparticular \nto \nlaparoscopic \nsurgery, \nincluding \ncomplications of pneumoperitoneum, injury to \nadjacent structures during trocar placement, and \ninjury to intra-abdominal structures during surgery. \nVascular injury during trocar placement, in \nparticular, can be fatal. Some complications arise \nwhen a familiar operation is done in a new way; one \nexample is the increase in biliary tract injuries that \noccurred after laparoscopic cholecystectomy was \nwidely adopted in the United States.  \n \nSome critics will argue that laparoscopy has \nno role in resource-limited settings like ours.",
  "Some critics will argue that laparoscopy has \nno role in resource-limited settings like ours. With \nscarce resources, they would say, the focus should be \non procedures that are likely to help the most people. \nCertainly we agree that safe access to lifesaving and \ndisability-preventing procedures should be primary \nin importance. However, in settings where these \n\u201cbasics\u201d are done well and are accessible to all, we \nfeel that the advantages of laparoscopy should not be \nwithheld from patients.  \nIt is possible to do laparoscopic surgery well \nin a resource-limited setting, but it must be done \ndifferently than in a resource-rich \ncountry. \nSpecifically, the use of disposable instruments \nshould be minimized. Reusable stainless steel \nlaparoscopic trocars and energy devices are available \nfrom India and China, where laparoscopy is being \ndone perhaps more commonly. Conversely, single-\nuse trocars and instruments from industrialized \ncountries will be harder to source and adapt for our \nsetting, and will malfunction if re-used beyond their \nintended lifespan.",
  "Conversely, single-\nuse trocars and instruments from industrialized \ncountries will be harder to source and adapt for our \nsetting, and will malfunction if re-used beyond their \nintended lifespan.  \n \nThe cannulas that allow laparoscopic access \nwithout letting pneumoperitoneum escape are \nvariably called ports or trocars; these two words are \nessentially interchangeable. In this chapter we will \nexplain trocar positioning and trocar placement. \nOther chapters will discuss pneumoperitoneum \noptions and alternatives, scopes and cameras, and use \nof energy devices. We will further discuss some \nspecific procedures in other chapters.  \n \nTrocar positioning: \n \nThe main goal of trocar positioning is to \nallow access of the camera and working trocars to the \nsurgical site. The best way to accomplish this is to \nthink in terms of a 4-sided \u201cdiamond,\u201d with the \nsurgical site at one corner, the camera\u2019s trocar at \nanother, and two working trocars at the other two \ncorners.

The reader will be well served by starting \nwith that chapter before reading this one.  \n \nAirway management for trauma victims can \nbe challenging for a variety of reasons. These include \ndistortion of airway anatomy, obscured visualization \nfrom blood, emesis or other material, and the need to \nmaintain the head in a neutral position when a \ncervical spine injury is suspected.

  "It is important to \nunderstand the particularities of each situation and \nhow to evaluate and to safely manage the airway in \nsuch patients. \nBefore the airway can be managed, it must be \nassessed. The steps in the evaluation of airway \npatency and adequacy of breathing will not be \ndiscussed in this chapter. The reader instead is \nreferred to Basic Life Support (BLS) and Advanced \nCardiac Life Support (ACLS) for further explanation \nof these steps. But it is important to understand that \nhypoxia and hypoventilation need to be recognized \nand acted upon quickly, as these can be signs of life-\nthreatening injuries and can worsen the level of \nconsciousness and brain injury in head-injured \npatients. Some of the particularities of airway \nmanagement in trauma victims are discussed below. \n \nCervical spine injury \nMost trauma patients are assumed to have a \ncervical spine injury until it is ruled out either by \nphysical exam or imaging.",
  "Some of the particularities of airway \nmanagement in trauma victims are discussed below. \n \nCervical spine injury \nMost trauma patients are assumed to have a \ncervical spine injury until it is ruled out either by \nphysical exam or imaging. Until such an injury has \nbeen ruled out the patient\u2019s neck must remain in a \nneutral position at all times using a properly placed \ncervical collar or manual in-line stabilization. This \ncan make intubation difficult or sometimes \nimpossible. Therefore, it is important to be prepared \nwith back-up airway equipment (e.g., bougie, \nvideolaryngoscope, cricothyroidotomy kit) before \nattempting intubation. If intubation fails the operator \nshould also be prepared to insert a rescue airway \ndevice such as a laryngeal mask airway. The \nesophageal-tracheal \nCombitube \nor \nKing \nsupralaryngeal device may be available at some \nhospitals and can be lifesaving in these situations. \nWhile these devices are not a permanent solution, \nthey can provide oxygenation and ventilation until a \nmore permanent airway can be established.",
  "While these devices are not a permanent solution, \nthey can provide oxygenation and ventilation until a \nmore permanent airway can be established. \n \nProper technique for cervical spine stabilization during \nintubation when cervical spine injury has not been ruled out. \nThe assistant (left side of the picture) uses the \u201cearmuff\u201d \ntechnique, which allows the mandible to move downwards. \nDuring insertion of the tube, the assistant and the intubator will \nbe working \u201cagainst\u201d each other, as one tries to see the vocal \ncords as well as possible and the other tries to limit movement \nof the neck.

This is one reason why securing \nthe airway is so critical whenever the patient\u2019s level \nof consciousness is depressed (Glasgow Coma Scale \n[GCS] less than 8).",
  "This is one reason why securing \nthe airway is so critical whenever the patient\u2019s level \nof consciousness is depressed (Glasgow Coma Scale \n[GCS] less than 8). Intubation should be performed \nwith rapid sequence induction in order to secure the \nairway as quickly as possible and protect the lungs \nfrom aspiration of gastric contents. This technique is \noutlined in the chapter on endotracheal intubation.  \nIn our institution, we use cricoid pressure in \nall rapid sequence inductions. In theory, this \nmaneuver serves to occlude the esophagus and \nprevent aspiration of gastric contents. However, \nstudies have questioned whether cricoid pressure \nactually achieves this effect. If used, this technique \nAirway Management in Trauma \nGregory Sund, Matthew Kynes, Phil Yao \n \nOPEN MANUAL OF SURGERY IN RESOURCE-LIMITED SETTINGS \nwww.vumc.org/global-surgical-atlas \nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License  \n \nshould be applied as soon as the patient loses \nconsciousness and released once endotracheal \nintubation is confirmed.",
  "The recommended pressure \nto be used is 3 to 4 kg at most. Excessive cricoid \npressure can cause further trauma to the airways. \nCricoid pressure can also obscure the view of the \nvocal cords, so ask the assistant to apply less pressure \nif you are having difficulty.  \n \nInhalational burns \nExposure to fire and smoke in an enclosed \nspace can cause inhalational injury to the airway \nresulting in progressive edema and airway closure. In \npatients \nwith \nsuspected \ninhalational \ninjury, \nendotracheal intubation should be performed early \nbefore significant airway edema occurs. Inhalational \ninjury should be suspected in any patient who was \nexposed to a fire in an enclosed space, those with \nsinged or soot-covered nostrils or mouth, and those \ndisplaying signs such as hoarseness, dyspnea, \ntachypnea or altered level of consciousness not \nexplained by head injury.",
  "While succinylcholine can \nbe used safely in patients within 48 hours of burn \ninjury, those outside of this time window are at \nincreased risk of hyperkalemia when given this \nmedication. In these situations, it is better to use a \nnon-depolarizing muscle relaxant.  \nPatients with severe burn injuries or those \nwhich occurred in enclosed spaces should also be \nconsidered at risk for carbon monoxide poisoning. \nCarbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin with an \naffinity approximately 250 times that of oxygen. \nThis results in a left-ward shift of the oxy-\nhemoglobin \ndissociation \ncurve \nand \nimpaired \navailability of oxygen at the level of the tissues. \nBecause standard pulse oximetry cannot distinguish \nbetween oxyhemoglobin and carboxyhemoglobin, \nthis tool will display a falsely elevated oxygen \nsaturation in a patient with carbon monoxide \npoisoning.",
  "Because standard pulse oximetry cannot distinguish \nbetween oxyhemoglobin and carboxyhemoglobin, \nthis tool will display a falsely elevated oxygen \nsaturation in a patient with carbon monoxide \npoisoning. In patients with carboxyhemoglobin \nlevels of 20% or greater (measured by arterial or \nvenous \nblood \ngas \nanalysis) \nintubation \nand \nmechanical ventilation will be necessary to improve \noxygenation and enhance carbon dioxide clearance \nby the body. \n \nHead and neck trauma \nAny patient with severe head and neck \ntrauma can have significant airway distortion which \ncan make direct laryngoscopy and endotracheal \nintubation difficult or impossible. Blood in the \nmouth and oropharynx is often encountered. \nAdequate suction should be immediately available \nbefore \nattempts \nat \nlaryngoscopy \nare \nmade. \nHematoma formation in the mouth or neck can also \ndistort \nanatomy \nmaking \nvisualization \nmore \nchallenging.

  "was discussed several \ntimes.  \nAt the end of a surgeon\u2019s training, the \nsurgeon is automatically placed in the role of a \nleader, whether or not they have acquired any \nleadership skills along the way. The surgeon\u2019s \nsuccess, and the fate of their patients, will depend on \ntheir ability to lead others. Surgical practice can not \nbe separated from leadership. \nThere are many different definitions of \nleadership. All of the following are appropriate: \n\u25cf The capability, natural or acquired, to guide, or \ninfluence a group towards the realization of a \ngoal \n\u25cf The ability to persuade and help others develop \nfuture visions and to motivate subordinates to \ndesire to achieve visions.  \n\u25cf The possession of the human factor that binds a \ngroup together and motivates it towards \nachieving goals \n \nBeing placed in a position of leadership does \nnot imply that you are a \u201cleader.\u201d Being a leader \nshould be more than the desire to be seen \u201cabove\u201d \nothers.

  "Rather, leadership is an obligation or a \nchallenge one feels to fulfill the related desires of the \npeople in one\u2019s circle of associates and beyond. It \nfollows from this observation that the best leaders are \noften not those who first seek out the role. Often \nleaders with the greatest influence take up the mantle \nof leadership not out of personal ambition, but \nbecause they believe in the values of the organization \nand want to see them carried on.  \nSurgery as a field requires more than just one \nsurgeon\u2019s skills: the clinic, the ward, and the \noperating room itself all have complex team \ndynamics at play. A surgeon contracts with the \npatient to successfully shepherd (lead) them through \nthe process of surgical care safely: This contract can \nbe made in seconds in the Casualty Department, or \nover painstaking months of clinic visits. But once \nthis contract is made, the surgeon is placed in a \nposition of leadership.  \nThe surgeon leader\u2019s position can be an \nawkward one: the patient\u2019s care will depend on the \nactions of myriad scrub techs, anesthetists, nurses, \nphysiotherapists, and other professionals including \nother physicians.",

The surgeon is not the \u201cboss\u201d of \nany of these people; there is no military-like \n\u201ccommand structure\u201d that allows the surgeon to give \norders and expect them to be obeyed. The leadership \nskills that are called for here are more subtle, and \nmore difficult to master. \nCommonly cited fundamentals of good \nleadership include the following: \n\u25cf Self-awareness \n\u25cf Self-control \n\u25cf Understanding others \n\u25cf Managing others \n \nAspiring leaders would be wise to cultivate \nthese qualities in the order they are presented above; \nthere is no self control without self awareness, and \nthere is no real understanding of others without \nunderstanding and mastering yourself.

  "A self-aware leader carries \nparticular characteristics: empathy, confidence, \nhumanity, and adaptability. People who cultivate \nthese abilities are usually able to communicate \neffectively, a trait we will explore more below.  \nWith self-awareness comes humility. Being \nself-aware, especially about your strengths and \nshortcomings, gives the ability to remain humble and \nwilling to learn. Admitting when you are mistaken \nand showing genuine desire to learn is an act of great \ncourage and humility, and thus defines a great leader \nHumility may at first seem similar to \ntimidity. But more correctly, humility is the exact \nopposite of timidity. As a general rule, every team \nmember wants a confident leader, but almost \neveryone also appreciates a humble one. It has been \nsaid that humility is a virtue, but timidity is a disease. \nAnyone who has to work with you, as subordinate or \nsuperior, will be disappointed if they see the lack of \ncourage and confidence from you as a leader. Thus, \ntimidity will defeat your attempts at leadership.",
  "Anyone who has to work with you, as subordinate or \nsuperior, will be disappointed if they see the lack of \ncourage and confidence from you as a leader. Thus, \ntimidity will defeat your attempts at leadership. On \nthe other hand, if you are humble enough to interact \nand listen, if you are humble enough to admit when \ncorrected even by your \u201csubordinates,\u201d you are more \nlikely to be supported and your wishes heeded. \nThis principle is most evident in those \nsituations, described above, where you must lead \npeople who are not your direct subordinates. The best \nexample is your relationship with the anesthesia \nstaff. If you are timid, you will be pushed around. If \nyou are overbearing, you will be ignored and \nresisted, either actively or passively. Neither \nsituation is best for the patient, or for your own job \nsatisfaction. But if you can be simultaneously \nhumble and sure of yourself, you will be most likely \nto have a collegial and supportive relationship, to \nyour own benefit and the patient\u2019s.",

But if you can be simultaneously \nhumble and sure of yourself, you will be most likely \nto have a collegial and supportive relationship, to \nyour own benefit and the patient\u2019s. \nThere are various ways to improve your self-\nawareness \u2013 be open-minded, think through your \nactions of the day, write down your desired plan and \ntrack your progress, have a circle of trusted friends \nand give them the independence to criticize you. \nAdaptability is the bridge between self-\nawareness and self-control. You must be able to \nchange your behavior as the situation changes. The \nexpectations on surgeons and surgical trainees is \nenormous, and the outcome of a leader\u2019s plans are \nnot always as desired. What makes a surgical leader \nstand out is the ability to see every opportunity as one \nto learn from. \n \nSelf-Control \nThis is the ability to resist impulses, maintain \nfocus, and strive to see projects to completion.

  "Self-Control \nThis is the ability to resist impulses, maintain \nfocus, and strive to see projects to completion. The \nwillpower to persistently dedicate your attention to a \ntask or project to a satisfactory end is self discipline. \nThis important trait has several facets: \n \nReliability  \nDoing what you say you will, being \ndependable, is key to high performance leadership. \nAs a leader it\u2019s upon you to set a positive tone for \ndesirable and acceptable behaviors- your example, \npositive or negative, will set the tone for everyone \nelse. You owe it to yourself and the team to be \ntrustworthy and reliable. Your co-workers or people \nyou lead should be able to count on you to take \ninitiative, meet deadlines, handle important details, \nand follow through with decisions you led in making, \nto communicate and to work well with them.  \nIt is also worth mentioning, at this point, that \nif you are reliable and those around you are not, they \nmay be following someone else\u2019s leadership in this \narea.

It \nis enough to mention here that changing a culture is \none of the supreme tests of a leader.  \n \nControl of Emotions  \nLeaders and non-leaders both have emotions. \nAs humans we should all strive to be in control of our \nemotions. \nUnfortunately, \nfor \nleaders, \nthat \nresponsibility is even greater than for other people. \nA truly great leader can certainly acknowledge that \nthe situation is desperate, and recognize that \nmembers of the team feel this desperation.

Like an athlete, your performance at any \nmoment will depend on your previous experience \nand training. Quite simply, a good leader understands \nthe domain they are leading others in, because they \nhave done the work and have the experience. What \nthis means, of course, is that a surgeon becomes a \nbetter leader as they accumulate more experience. So \nmake the most of the experience you have: prepare \nfor it, learn from it, and reflect on it afterwards. The \nrelevant saying here (attributed to various authors) is \n\u201cGood judgment comes from experience. Experience \ncomes from bad judgment.\u201d An experienced surgeon \nhas the judgment to lead others into territory where \nthey themselves have been in before.  \n \nUnderstanding Others  \nThis trait is a product and a natural result of \nunderstanding yourself.

  "Understanding Others  \nThis trait is a product and a natural result of \nunderstanding yourself. There is no leader with the \ngood fortune of leading only people with the same \ncharacteristics and behaviors. Thus it is important for \nthe leader to try to understand all of the team, their \nstrengths and weaknesses, and especially the ways in \nwhich these strengths and weaknesses are different \nfrom the leader\u2019s own strengths and weaknesses. \n \nPaying Attention \n \nIn order to understand others, you must first \nbelieve that it is necessary to do so. Please let us \nremind you that it is. You will not be an effective \nleader if you do not make the time and the effort to \nunderstand the motivations, hopes, fears, and even \nthe little \u201cquirks\u201d that make up the people you lead. \nYes, you must know whether someone is \ntrustworthy, or whether they have the skills they \nclaim that they do.

A team member whose strengths are known, \nvalued, and used will enjoy being part of the team, \nand the whole team will be better because of it.  \n \nEmpathy \nIn psychology, empathy is defined as \n\u201cunderstanding another person\u2019s experience by \nimaging oneself in that other person\u2019s situation.\u201d \nEmotional intelligence is a strong foundation for this \ncharacteristic, and when a leader has it, they build \nstronger relationships with the team. Surgical \nleadership, especially when leading trainees from \ndifferent backgrounds, requires identifying with \nthem and their points of view. Be very slow to judge \nthem or their ideas, but recognize their emotions. \n \nKindness  \nMany leaders would advise keeping some \n\u201cdistance\u201d between yourself and those you lead. \nOthers think this is nonsense.

There, \nI met the single scrub team just finishing a case, \nabout to take their first break all night.

There are \ntwo key attitudes to take to avoid this trap: \nFirst of all, learn to recognize which \ndecisions must be made urgently and which can wait. \nA good leader appreciates having time to find the \nsolution to a complex problem and does not let the \n\u201cfelt urgency\u201d of others push him to act rashly. One \ngood mental exercise is to ask yourself two \nquestions, and then decide which would lead to a \nworse outcome: \n1.

This technique \ninvolves inserting a temporary conduit, called a \nshunt, into the blood vessel to bypass the damaged or \nblocked segment.

The overall problem is worsened by the \nfollowing factors, that contribute to the development \nof malnutrition:  \n\u25cf The broad perception that the provision of food \nand nutrition is of low priority  \n\u25cf The alignment of nutrition with patient service \nrather than medical services  \n\u25cf The difficult in responding to patient preferences, \nor clinician requests for certain types of food \nresources \n\u25cf Repeated fasting and skipping of meals \nassociated \nwith \nsurgical \nand \nmedical \ninterventions \nThe patient\u2019s nutrition status is therefore a \nmajor determinant of outcomes for any type of \nsurgery.

  "Importance of Pre-operative Management \nMalnutrition is a modifiable risk factor. It can \nbe tamed pre-operatively through nutritional support. \nPreoperative nutrition support optimizes patient \nnutrition status, preparing the patient for increased \nmetabolic demands due to surgical injury.  \nUnder normal conditions, fatty acids are \nmobilized in states of starvation, in a process called \nketosis. Infection and injury inhibit this response and \ninstead cause the mobilization of muscle protein. \nThis process leads to generalized muscle weakness, \nedema, and weight loss. Severe malnutrition can \nweaken the respiratory muscle, making the patient \nunable to cough effectively which promotes chest \ninfection and atelectasis. The immune response to \ninfection also becomes down-regulated and T-cell, \nB-cell and macrophage function deteriorates. \nNutrition assessment includes collecting \ninformation about the patient\u2019s medical history, \nclinical and biochemical characteristics, dietary \npractices, current medication(s), and food security \nsituation, and taking anthropometric measurements. \nThere is no single standard for identifying either \nnutrition risk or nutrition status.",

It is a good option for \ncovering even large wounds, as split thickness skin \ncan be expanded to cover more space than the area it \ncame from, through the process of \u201cmeshing\u201d which \nis described further below. Skin grafts, either split or \nfull thickness, are not useful for pressure ulcers; an \noption that is more tolerant of pressure must be used \nin this situation. \nSplit thickness grafts can be harvested in \nvarious thicknesses, as discussed further below. \nEvery split thickness graft will contract after being \nplaced; the thinner a graft is, the more it will contract.",
  "Split thickness grafts can be harvested in \nvarious thicknesses, as discussed further below. \nEvery split thickness graft will contract after being \nplaced; the thinner a graft is, the more it will contract. \nConversely, the thicker a graft is, the less it will \ncontract, and the stronger and more resistant it is to \ntrauma. The strength of increased thickness comes at \nthe price of a slightly higher chance that the graft will \nnot \u201ctake,\u201d or successfully implant at the graft site.  \nIt is acceptable to use split thickness grafts on \nthe face in certain situations, although in general they \nshould be avoided because of their tendency to \ncontract. When used on the face, they should be thick \nand not \u201cmeshed\u201d because of the cosmetic effects of \ndoing so. \n \nTypical appearance of a meshed skin graft after healing.

  "Therefore, the surgeon must \nassure that there are sufficient epidermal cells \nremaining at the donor site after harvest, and that the \nrecipient site will support these newly arrived cells \nafter their transplantation.  \n \nTo assure that living cells remain at the donor \nsite after harvest, the graft must be taken at a depth \nthat is less than the hair follicles. The donor site will \nre-epithelialize by migration of these cells, from the \nhair follicles, into the rest of the wound. Hair \nfollicles\u2019 depth is variable depending on the part of \nthe body, but in general they are located at about 2-\n3mm of depth. So the dermatome, whether manual or \nmechanical, must be set to a depth to leave a good \ndeal of the hair follicle behind. Most skin grafts \nharvest skin around 0.3-0.5mm deep. It is the \nsurgeon\u2019s responsibility to make sure that the \ndermatome is set properly and remains so, harvesting \nneither to little nor too much skin.",

Hospitals in resource- limited \nsettings have a great challenge responding to these \nissues. To achieve the best possible outcomes, it is \nparamount to consider management of mass casualty \nincidents in advance and to be prepared for them long \nbefore they occur.  \nManagement of mass casualty is a broad \nsubject including several perspectives: a centralized \ngovernment perspective, a pre-hospital, emergency \nmedical services perspective, and a hospital \nperspective.

  "In the hopes of being most beneficial to \nthe reader, this chapter is written from a hospital \nperspective. It is understood that in most resource-\nlimited settings, pre-hospital care, and even pre-\nhospital coordination and allocation of patients, is \nnon-existent. Patients often arrive at your facility \nwith little or no warning, in excess of what you can \nsafely handle, with no option to transfer elsewhere.  \nWhile there is no consensus definition for a \n\u201cmass casualty,\u201d we will adopt the World Health \nOrganization definition: A mass casualty incident is \nan event which generates more patients at one \ntime than locally available resources can manage \nusing routine procedures. It requires exceptional \nemergency arrangements and additional or \nextraordinary assistance. \nNotably, what qualifies as a mass casualty \nincident will be very specific to the practice setting. \nFor example, two or three patients arriving \nsimultaneously in a more rural hospital with only one \navailable provider may overwhelm that specific \nsystem, particularly in the low resource setting. \nHowever, even in limited resource urban centers, the \nsame volume of patients may be appropriately \nmanaged.",

In order to adequately handle each \nsituation, it is crucial to be critically honest about a \nfacility's capabilities. \n \nIn this chapter, we discuss the Mass Casualty \nin three phases: Before, During, and After the event. \n \nA mass casualty event at a large hospital. Facilities with \ntraining programs can call on multiple workers quickly to deal \nwith a rapid influx of patients.  \n \nBefore \n \nAnticipation of and preparation for a mass \ncasualty incident will lead to improved outcomes \nSpecifically, it will be vital to understand the \nlandscape of resources available at your current \nfacility. \nBelow, \nwe \ndiscuss \nPersonnel, \nEquipment/Supplies, Medicines, Space, and Medical \nRecords.

This will allow you to ensure that supplies \nand other resources can be well utilized by the \npersonnel. Additionally, if there are training or skill \ndeficiencies identified prior to a Mass Casualty, \npersonnel can be recruited and trained.  \nIt would be ideal to have a full complement \nof operating theater, laboratory, x-ray and central \nsupply technicians on duty 24-hours per day; the \nhospital leadership needs to decide whether they are \nbusy enough to justify this expense. A small rural \nhospital that is unstaffed on evenings and weekends \nshould encourage injured patients to be sent \nelsewhere, \nproviding \nbasic \nresuscitation \nand \nstabilization prior to transfer.  \n \nAncillary Staff \n \nSmall hospitals face the disadvantage that \nmany of these skilled workers are not in the hospital \n24 hours per day.",

Tangential excision was \npioneered by Dr. Zora Jan\u017eekovi\u010d through her work \nwith burn patients in the former Yugoslavia in the \n1960s. Since then, it has become the standard of care \nin resource-rich settings where there may be ready \naccess to blood products and general anesthesia.

  "In \ncontrast, in resource limited settings, conservative \nmanagement is pursued, as this is often safer for the \npatient. This approach consists of wound care until \nthe burn eschar has sloughed off, leaving a \ngranulating wound that can be grafted. However, in \nmany cases (including the examples shown in this \nchapter) it is safer and more expedient to excise \ntissue that is clearly burned.  \nBurn wounds can be excised in a tangential \nor fascial manner.  Tangential excision is performed \nmost often and involves sequential excision of \nburned tissue until viable tissue is reached.  This can \nbe done with a number of different surgical \ninstruments.  Most commonly, sharp excision is \nperformed with the Watson knife or the Goulian-\nWeck blade. Progenitors of these instruments such as \nthe Rosenburg, Thiersch, and Humby knives are still \nused at some institutions.",

A major limitation of tangential excision is blood \nloss, and it is important to take steps to minimize \nsurgical blood loss.  Studies have demonstrated \nstandard blood loss of 40-80 cc per 100 cm2 of \nexcised tissue.

The procedure can also easily be \nadapted to a trans-vaginal approach if the abscess can \nbe more easily reached in this manner.",
  "The procedure can also easily be \nadapted to a trans-vaginal approach if the abscess can \nbe more easily reached in this manner.  \nAs mentioned above, a common indication is \ndevelopment of a pelvic abscess after laparotomy for \nabdominal sepsis. Other indications include pelvic \ninflammatory disease with abscess that has not \nresponded to antibiotics, or conditions such as \nperforated appendicitis that lead to an abscess in the \npelvis. On rare occasions, a perianal abscess will \ndrain \u201cupwards\u201d and create an abscess in the pelvis, \nin the supralevator space. Usually such an abscess \nwill also have a perianal component that you can feel \nwhen palpating the perineum. If not, this diagnosis \ncan be extremely difficult to make without a CT scan.  \nWhen trans-rectal drainage of an abscess is \nperformed in resource-rich settings, the technique is \nas follows: a needle is inserted into the abscess, \nfollowed by passage of a guidewire, dilation of the \ntract, and placement of a catheter in the abscess.",

There are many ways \nto anastomose bowel using sutures, staples, or a \ncombination of the two. All successful anastomoses \nwill involve well vascularized tissue, under no \ntension, with the bowel being inverted, or folded into \nitself. Our technique is easy to learn, easy to teach, \nand relatively safe even in inexperienced hands. \nPlease note as you review the pictures that this \ntechnique assumes both surgeons sew the inner layer \nby passing the needle from their left to their right. \n \nThis is the same two layered technique we \nuse for Billroth 1 gastroduodenostomy after partial \ngastrectomy, see that chapter for more photos and \nexplanation of the technique.",

The two ends of the bowel should not be kinked \nor twisted- this can be confirmed by aligning the \nmesenteries of both segments. The two ends \nshould meet with absolutely no tension. \nEspecially when anastomosing the colon, we \nprefer to see and feel a pulsatile vessel in the \nmesentery immediately adjacent to the cut edge \nof the bowel. Place a traction suture through the \nserosa and muscular layer of the mesenteric and \nantimesenteric sides of the bowel to align it.",

  "Delivery of a Severely Impacted Fetus:  \nThese can be some of the most challenging \nCesarean births.

Considering the complexity of systems \nissues, the high stress of surgery, and imperfect \npeople, we should expect to encounter conflict on a \ndaily basis.

An operating \ntheater or ward where people are afraid to speak up \nout of a desire to \u201cavoid conflict\u201d is a dangerous \nplace indeed.

Considering a different point of view, \nwhich sometimes comes with conflict, can open up \nnew possibilities and help to generate new ideas that \nmight otherwise have not been considered. \n \nConflict Raises Questions \nOrganizational conflict usually leads to a \nseries of questions for those on both sides of any \nissues. These questions can lead to new ideas and \nbreakthroughs \nin \nthinking \nthat \ncan \nbenefit \nindividuals, departments, and organizations. When \nthere is no conflict, nothing changes. There is no \nneed to question or challenge the status quo. Conflict \nrepresents an opportunity to reconsider, which can \nlead to breakthrough thinking. \n \nConflict Builds Relationships \nBeing agreeable is nice, but encouraging \nconflict can actually strengthen relationships.",

For those moments where this is not \npossible, here are a few brief thoughts:  \nFirst, try to remain emotionally aware. If you \nsense your pulse skyrocketing, acknowledge it. \nSome find that a few deep breaths through the nose \nhelps slow down an accelerating sense of fury or \noutrage.  \nSecond, try to assume positive intent. \nReminding yourself that the person on the other side \nof the conflict is a good person and wants good for \nthe patient- this approach can help you view her/him \ndifferently. Similarly, try reminding yourself to be \ncurious about why someone is doing something \nseemingly egregious, understanding that they intend \ngood for the patient.  \nThird, humble yourself, no matter who is at \nfault, and ask for help.

Great leaders use \ntheir experiences to promote growth. It\u2019s been said \nthat we don\u2019t grow from our experiences, we grow \nfrom reflecting on them. If you want to improve the \nway you manage conflict, try scheduling regular time \nto review your past week and consider how you \nperformed during times of duress, particularly as it \nrelates to conflict.

Is \nthere anyone that you need to reach out to in order to \nresolve something that still feels unsettled? Do you \nmaybe even need to apologize? Admittedly, making \nroom in our busy schedules for this time of reflection \nis challenging. But if we don\u2019t, we\u2019re unlikely to \nmake any changes next time. \nSecond, try your best to view episodes of \nconflict (and any failures in management on your \npart) as opportunities to grow, not indictments of \nyour ability.

  "The mediastinal extension of the gland then rests in \nthe space posterior to the innominate and subclavian \nvessels, carotid sheath, RLN, and inferior thyroid \nartery. Therefore, the normal relationship of the \nthyroid gland and the RLN is reversed. The RLN \nbecomes ventral to the inferior component of the \nthyroid and, if not recognized early on, can be \nstretched, or inadvertently cut. The nerve can also be \nentrapped between components of the posterior \nmediastinal goiter. This increased rate of RLN injury \nis \nwell \ndocumented \nin \nseries \ncomparing \nthyroidectomy using only a cervical approach to \nsternotomy with mediastinal dissection to aid \ncervical removal.

  "In those small series, there is a \nsignificantly decreased rate of RLN injury in patients \nwho \nunderwent \nsternotomy \nfor \nmediastinal \ndissection.  \nPosterior mediastinal goiters can come to rest \nin a space bounded inferiorly by the azygous vein, \nposteriorly by the vertebral column, laterally by the \nfirst rib, medially by the trachea and esophagus, and \nanteriorly by the carotid sheath, subclavian and \ninnominate vessels, superior vena cava, and phrenic \nand RLNs. Therefore, it is important to be familiar \nwith the regional anatomy of the lower neck and \nupper mediastinum.  \nPosterior mediastinal goiters can occur on the \nsame side as the enlarged lobe (Type IIA) or may \ncome to rest through a retro-tracheal extension in the \ncontralateral thorax (Type IIB.)

Most gastric tumors \nare adenocarcinomas and require margins of 5cm; \nformal gastric resections (Distal, Subtotal or Total \ngastrectomy) are described elsewhere in this atlas.  \nSituations that demand only a localized \nresection are rarer.  These include Gastrointestinal \nStromal tumors, Neuroendocrine tumors (formerly \ncalled \u201cCarcinoid,\u201d) and gastric lymphomas that \nhave perforated during chemotherapy. In such cases \na margin of 1cm is acceptable. The focus should be \non removing the tumor, maintaining the reservoir \nfunction of the stomach, and assuring a closure that \nwill be unlikely to leak postoperatively.",
  "In such cases \na margin of 1cm is acceptable. The focus should be \non removing the tumor, maintaining the reservoir \nfunction of the stomach, and assuring a closure that \nwill be unlikely to leak postoperatively.  \n \nBe careful using partial gastrectomy on the \nlesser curvature of the stomach: it is possible to \nresect small tumors here, but at least one branch of \nthe vagus nerve should be preserved. If this is not \npossible, perform a distal or subtotal gastrectomy \ninstead. If both branches of the vagus are severed, the \nstomach will not drain properly. \nThe surgeon must be certain of the histology \nof the tumor: using wedge gastrectomy as an \n\u201cexcisional biopsy\u201d is unwise, as the most likely \ncause of a neoplastic mass in the stomach is \nadenocarcinoma. If you have no access to \nimmunostaining, a gastric spindle cell neoplasm in \nthe submucosa of the stomach wall (by plain \nhistology) is enough evidence to assume a \nGastrointestinal Stromal tumor, in our opinion.",

It is robust, meaning that it can \nsuccessfully be used by \u201coccasional\u201d plastic \nsurgeons. Its primary neurovascular pedicle is easy \nto find and to preserve during harvest.  \nThe LD is a fan-shaped muscle about 30 cm \nin length, originating from the spinous processes of \nT7-L5 vertebrae, the 7th to 12th ribs, and the posterior \nsuperior iliac spine.",
  "The LD is a fan-shaped muscle about 30 cm \nin length, originating from the spinous processes of \nT7-L5 vertebrae, the 7th to 12th ribs, and the posterior \nsuperior iliac spine. It inserts on the medial aspect of \nthe head of the humerus, between the insertions of \nthe teres major and pectoralis major muscles. It \nfunctions to adduct and internally rotate the upper \narm, as well as to support the trunk. In its absence \narm adduction is weakened and the back symmetry \nis lost. Its primary vascular supply is the \nthoracodorsal artery and vein, which originate off the \n3rd portion of the subclavian vessels. Its nerve supply \nis the thoracodorsal nerve, which runs with the artery \nand vein.  \nThe standard LD flap is created by detaching \nthe fan-shaped portion of the muscle from the chest \nwall, often including some of the overlying skin. \nWhen completely detached up to the axilla, it can \nprovide soft tissue coverage in a range up to about \n30cm from the head of the humerus.",
  "When completely detached up to the axilla, it can \nprovide soft tissue coverage in a range up to about \n30cm from the head of the humerus. This area \nencompasses the upper arm, axilla, breast and \nanterior chest wall, anterior and lateral neck, and \neven the floor of mouth, cheek, or oropharynx.  \nAlthough the LD flap will easily reach the \noral cavity and even the temporal region or skull \nbase, it is not commonly used in head and neck \nreconstruction. This is because the volume of muscle \nadds  bulk wherever it is placed, and there are other \neasier and less morbid flap options in the head and \nneck, described elsewhere in this Manual.  \nThe LD flap is most commonly used for \nreconstruction of chest wall defects, reconstruction \nafter mastectomy, and closure of defects on the \nanterior or lateral neck if a large amount of tissue is \nneeded. This flap can be transferred with muscle \nalone, without a skin paddle.",

This flap can be transferred with muscle \nalone, without a skin paddle.  \n \nThe latissimus dorsi (Red Arrow) is a long, flat, fan-shaped \nmuscle which can be rotated around the axis of its \nthoracodorsal vascular pedicle, with or without division of the \nmuscle near to its insertion on the humerus. \n \n \nFor deeply scarred burn contractures, a musculocutaneous flap \nprovides a superior result compared to a full thickness skin \ngraft.

We disagree: a tracheostomy scar never looks \ngood after tube removal. The poor cosmetic \nappearance  is not due to the length of the incision, \nbut to the tube passing through it. By using a slightly \nwider incision, the surgeon can safely achieve \nhemostasis and take measures to avoid excessive \nbleeding or tracheal stenosis, which we describe \nfurther below.",

These patients will \nrequire awake tracheostomy, a challenging but not \nimpossible procedure.  This operation can be done \nexactly as described below, with frequent and \ncopious injection of local anesthetic.  \n \nTracheostomy is never a suitable procedure \nfor emergency airway access; cricothyroidotomy is \nmuch more appropriate in this situation.

If \na hollow viscus herniates through a defect in the \ndiaphragm, diagnosis can easily be made with a plain \nchest x-ray. But if the injury consists of only a \nlaceration in the diaphragm, it must be diagnosed by \ndirect visualization. In this chapter we discuss \ndecision making in patients at risk for diaphragmatic \ninjury and surgical planning for patients with acute \nor chronic presentation of diaphragmatic hernia.  \nBlunt diaphragmatic injury is caused by a \nsudden increase in intra-abdominal pressure, which \nleads to rupture of the diaphragm.

When \nbowel is herniated through the defect, the diagnosis \ncan be made by seeing viscera above the left \nhemidiaphragm on imaging.  \nPenetrating diaphragmatic injury is caused by \na stab or gunshot wound in the \u201cJunctional Region,\u201d \nanywhere between the nipples and the costal margin \nanteriorly, or the tips of the scapula and the costal \nmargins posteriorly. Stab or gunshot wounds in this \nregion can also injure the heart, great vessels, \nesophagus, lungs, or chest wall vessels. The \ndiaphragm defect is smaller than in blunt injury, \nusually the size of the penetrating object. Because of \nthis fact, herniation of viscera is often not present on \npresentation, making these injuries difficult to \ndiagnose.

Whilst \nthe radical mastectomy and modified radical \nmastectomy include an axillary lymph node \ndissection, the simple mastectomy is usually \nperformed with a sentinel node biopsy to stage the \naxilla and if the sentinel node is positive, the axilla is \nthen treated with a completion lymph node dissection \nor more recently with axillary radiotherapy to avoid \na second surgical procedure. Axillary Dissection is \ndiscussed in a separate chapter.",

The incisions involve removing an ellipse of \nskin along with the breast tissue, the nipple-areolar \ncomplex and the amount of skin removed depends on \nthe size of the breast. The aim of a good mastectomy \nis to remove enough skin so there is no redundant \nskin on the chest wall at the end of the mastectomy, \nbut at the same time not removing too much skin \nmaking closure of the wound difficult.

In such cases a nasogastric tube may \nbe placed and the aspirate examined: if it is bilious \nwithout blood, an upper GI source is unlikely. If \nthere is no output or the output is clear only, an upper \nGI hemorrhage has not been ruled out. This test is the \nonly role of nasogastric tube placement in GI \nhemorrhage.

  "When \nthese collateral veins are near to a mucosal surface, \nthey bulge into the lumen of the organ.

The majority \nof these people live in low- and middle-income \ncountries. As the availability of surgical services \nincreases in these settings, the need for treatments for \nmoderate to severe perioperative pain will also \nincrease. The barriers to improving access to \ntreatment for pain are numerous and include low \nprioritization of pain relief by both the patient and the \nhealthcare provider, lack of understanding regarding \ntherapies, misconceptions about opioid addiction, \nlack of reliable supply chains for analgesics, and lack \nof understanding regarding the physical, social and \nemotional harms of poorly controlled pain.  \nDespite these obstacles, it has been shown \nthat improvements in pain management are possible, \neven in low-resource settings.",
  "Despite these obstacles, it has been shown \nthat improvements in pain management are possible, \neven in low-resource settings. In recent years there \nhas been growth in both research and advocacy \nrelated to pain management in austere settings. \nHowever, without access to pain management \neducation these efforts will be wasted. Essential Pain \nManagement (EPM) is one example of a step toward \nimproving access to education in pain management. \nEPM was developed in 2010 as a short course (one \nto two days) to be delivered to healthcare providers \nof different cadres to equip these providers with the \nnecessary tools to recognize, assess and treat pain, \nespecially in low-resource settings.

Chest wall and \nabdominal pain can lead to shallow breathing \ncausing atelectasis. Patients who are in severe pain \nwill be less likely to ambulate, increasing the risk of \nthrombotic complications. Severe pain will also lead \nto disturbances in sleep patterns and poor appetite. \nAt a more personal level, pain is closely linked to \ndepressed mood and social stress. All of these \ncomplications inevitably lead to increased duration \nof hospitalization and increased cost of healthcare.  \nFinally, there is a growing body of evidence \nthat suggests that poorly controlled surgical pain can \nlead to the development of chronic pain (pain at the \nsite of incision which continues for greater than three \nmonths).",
  "Finally, there is a growing body of evidence \nthat suggests that poorly controlled surgical pain can \nlead to the development of chronic pain (pain at the \nsite of incision which continues for greater than three \nmonths). For all of these reasons and many more, we \nbelieve that recognizing, assessing and treating \nperioperative pain is of great importance in the \nsurgical care of patients in any setting.  \n \nPathophysiology \n \nThe International Association for the Study \nof Pain defines pain as \u201can unpleasant sensory and \nemotional experience associated with actual or \npotential tissue damage, or described in terms of such \ndamage.\u201d \nThis \ndefinition \nhighlights \nseveral \nimportant points. First, the pain pathways are \nintricately linked to the cortical emotional centers of \nthe brain. Pain can contribute to anxiety and \ndepression which can, in turn, worsen pain. Second, \ntissue damage does not need to be obvious for a \npatient to be suffering from pain.

  "These impulses \nare then relayed to the opposite side of the spinal cord \nand travel cephalad to the thalamus, the second relay \ncenter. From the thalamus, signals are transmitted to \nnumerous areas of the brain (including the limbic \nsystem) where the \u201cperception of pain\u201d occurs.

Addiction occurs \nwhen patients take morphine for purposes that it is \nnot indicated for, either to manage pain chronically \nor for recreational use. For patients with acute severe \npain, however, morphine is most certainly indicated \nand it can be given safely if one is aware of the \nappropriate dosing and understands how to monitor \nfor side effects. \nFor most patients with severe pain, a starting \ndose of intravenous morphine between 0.05 mg/kg \nand 0.2 mg/kg is appropriate, depending on their \nlevel of pain.

  "This dose should be given every 3 to 4 \nhours for patients who continue to be in severe pain. \nIf patients can take oral medications, oral morphine \n(syrup or tabs) may be more appropriate and has \ncertain advantages, including slower onset and \noffset, lower cost, and the elimination of the need for \nan intravenous line to administer. The dose of oral \nmorphine needs to be doubled or tripled compared to \nintravenous dosing due to its first-pass hepatic \nmetabolism which rapidly reduces the active amount \nin the bloodstream. For example, a patient requiring \n5 mg of intravenous morphine every 4 hours, may \nneed 15 mg of oral morphine every 4 hours.  \nWe discourage the use of intramuscular \nmorphine for a variety of reasons.

As \ndescribed here, the cervix is left in place (especially \nif done by an inexperienced surgeon), unlike elective \nhysterectomy.  \n \nIntroduction:  \nPeripartum hysterectomy is a unique surgery \nthat occurs when a hysterectomy is indicated after a \nbirth has occurred, either via vaginal or Cesarean \nroute.

  "It is often called \u201cCesarean hysterectomy\u201d if it \noccurs after a Cesarean birth. In some rare cases, the \nhysterectomy is planned. More often, it is a surgical \nemergency that becomes necessary after the delivery \nhas occurred. While Cesarean deliveries are one of \nthe most common major surgeries worldwide, it is \nestimated that less than 1% of all Cesarean deliveries \nend in hysterectomy.  \nThe most common planned indication for a \nCesarean hysterectomy is placenta accreta spectrum. \nIn this scenario, the placenta is abnormally attached \nto the uterus. Often the safest mode of action is to \ndeliver the baby then remove the uterus and placenta \ntogether. The most common unplanned reason for a \nperipartum \nhysterectomy \nis \nuncontrolled \nhemorrhage, such as with refractory uterine atony, \nuterine rupture or an extension of the hysterotomy \ninto uterine vessels.",

After the birth of the baby, via vaginal route or \nCesarean, if significant bleeding occurs that \ncannot be stopped with uterine massage and use \nof uterotonics, and is deemed to be due to uterine \natony, all uterotonics available at the facility \nshould be exhausted as a first line measure.

Also assure that that \nretained products of conception are not \ncontributing to the bleeding- all products of \nconception, such as fragments of the placenta, \nmust be evacuated. \n2.

  "2. At this stage, it is important to notify anesthesia \nof blood loss and consider administration of \nblood products. In addition, adequate IV access \nshould be re-assessed at this point.

If \nsuccessful, placement of a balloon for treatment \nof uterine atony can negate the need for surgical \ntreatment including a peripartum hysterectomy \nand salvage the patient\u2019s uterus. Commonly used \ncompression balloons are the treatment of uterine \natony are Bakari balloons or multiple Foley \nballoons inflated to their maximum capacity. If \nintrauterine balloon catheters are utilized, it is \nimportant to also place a Foley catheter in the \nbladder to drain urine as the urethra will often be \nobstructed by the compression balloon. \n4.

If surgical management is chosen after a vaginal \ndelivery, the following steps should be taken to \nprepare (these would already have been taken if \nthe delivery is a Cesarean): \n\u2022 Administer prophylactic antibiotics. Ideal \npreoperative antibiotics are a first-generation \ncephalosporin (e.g. cefazolin 1g IV for \npatients 80 kg, 2-3g IV for patients > 80 kg) \nadministered in the hour prior to surgery.  \n\u2022 Place a urinary catheter.  \n\u2022 Consider thromboembolism prophylaxis.

Thus, it is \nvery important to identify the utero-ovarian \nligament correctly during steps 11 and 12.  \n\u2022 The most common complications of Cesarean \nhysterectomy are significant blood loss and \nurinary tract damage. These complications are \nhigher when the procedure is being performed \nemergently.

Coagulopathies may \npresent prior to the procedure or as the surgery \nprogresses.  \n\u2022 Urinary Tract Damage: The most common \nlocation of bladder injury is the dome, especially \nif the patient has had a previous Cesarean birth. \nUrinary tract damage is identified by cystoscopy \nor by retrograde instillation of fluid through a \nfoley catheter into the bladder, either sterile milk \nor methylene blue.

As a country advances \neconomically however, penetration of hemodialysis \nwill increase. The surgeon will be called on to place \ntemporary or permanent dialysis catheters and to \ncreate arteriovenous fistulas.  \nThe basic principle of an arteriovenous \nfistula is this: when a vein is subjected to arterial \nblood flow, it dilates and its wall becomes thickened. \nSuch a fistula should have enough blood flow to \npermit rapid withdrawal and replacement of blood \nduring hemodialysis (350-800mL/minute.) The \nthickened walls are able to withstand repeated \nvenipuncture. If such a vein is near enough to the \nskin, it can be repeatedly accessed by a non-\nphysician for hemodialysis.",
  "The \nthickened walls are able to withstand repeated \nvenipuncture. If such a vein is near enough to the \nskin, it can be repeatedly accessed by a non-\nphysician for hemodialysis. Reaching this condition \ntakes at least 6 weeks, sometimes several months.  \nDecision \non \ncriteria \nfor \nlong-term \nhemodialysis is generally not the purview of the \nsurgeon. (Conversely, the surgeon must be well \naware of the criteria for short term dialysis in case of \nacute kidney injury. Briefly, they are acidosis, \nvolume overload, uremia, hyperkalemia and need for \nclearance of toxins.) \n \nAnatomy:  \n \nThe arm is preferred over the leg for fistula \ncreation. Whereas the arterial anatomy of the arm \nvaries only rarely, the venous anatomy is highly \nvariable. \n \nThe brachial artery in the upper arm runs within the muscle \nfascia.

  "The prosthetic material, if used, is usually \npolytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, various brands.) \nFistulas are most commonly connected end-vein to \nside-artery.

Infection of the graft \nmandates removal, but it is unclear whether such \ninfections occur more frequently in resource-limited \nsettings such as ours.  \nArteriovenous fistulae are generally placed in \nfour common locations: \n\u25cf Distal radial-cephalic: the end of the cephalic \nvein is anastomosed to the side of the radial \nartery at the wrist.

  "This fistula has perhaps the \nlowest success rate of all due to the frequently \nsmall size of the vein here. However, it can be \ndone under local anesthesia and if it fails, another \nfistula can be attempted more proximally in the \narm. The converse is not true: if a proximal \nfistula has failed, a more distal one is unlikely to \nsucceed. Another advantage to this fistula is that \nin >95% of patients, the hand will remain viable \neven if the radial artery is irreversibly damaged \nthrough surgical misadventure, because of the \nulnar artery and the palmar arch. Similarly, \u201csteal \nsyndrome,\u201d the loss of perfusion to the distal arm \ndue to excessive flow through the fistula, occurs \nonly rarely. Creation of a wrist level AVF is \nadvised if the vein is adequate, as patients on \nlong-term dialysis need as many possible fistula \nsites preserved as possible.  \n\u25cf Proximal radial-cephalic: the end of the cephalic \nvein is anastomosed to the side of the radial \nartery in the forearm.",

It is a useful option if \nveins in this area are large, and it does not prevent \na fistula based on the brachial artery later. The \nadvantages of radial artery fistula described \nabove also apply here.  \n\u25cf Brachial-cephalic: The end of the cephalic or \nlateral antebrachial cutaneous vein is attached to \nthe side of the brachial artery. This operation is \ntechnically easy to perform; all the vessels \ninvolved are relatively large and superficial. The \nmajor disadvantage is the potential for steal \nsyndrome.

As a result of \nthe intense inflammation that occurs when pancreatic \nenzymes \nencounter \nintraabdominal \nstructures, \npancreatic pseudocysts are lined by a thick capsule \nof fibrosed granulation tissue. \nPancreatic pseudocysts often occur as the \nconsequence of acute pancreatitis, but can also occur \nafter chronic pancreatitis, because of iatrogenic \ninjury (after instrumentation or surgery,) or after \npancreatic trauma.

We \nwill divide these factors into those that are internal to \nthe offending organism and factors that are external \nto the offending organism.   \n \nFactors internal to the organism \nOrganism type: The first major internal \nfactor is the type of microorganism(s) present on the \nobject and whether or not spores are involved.",

Each type of organism has a varying \nlevel of susceptibility to destruction, which is related \nto its physical structure (i.e lipid envelope or protein \ncapsid). For example, spores are generally resistant \nto most disinfectants while mycobacteria are \ngenerally resistant to alcohol, and prions are resistant \nto heat at 200 oC for as long as two hours.   \nOrganism quantity: Just as microbes grow at \nan exponential rate, microbes also die at an \nexponential rate.  As the number of organisms \nincreases, a longer exposure time is required to \nachieve disinfection or sterility.",
  "Organism quantity: Just as microbes grow at \nan exponential rate, microbes also die at an \nexponential rate.  As the number of organisms \nincreases, a longer exposure time is required to \nachieve disinfection or sterility. Proper cleaning with \nwater and detergent or enzymatic cleansers prior to \ndisinfection or sterilization can help to reduce the \nmicrobial load and increase the effectiveness of the \ndisinfectant or sterilant.  \nMost bacteria create a biofilm on solid \norganic or inorganic surfaces when the number of \norganisms reaches a certain level. The biofilms \ncontain an extracellular matrix of proteins and \npolysaccharides that encourage binding of more \nbacteria both to the matrix and to each other, \nproviding stability, nutrition, and protection. \nBiofilms are known to significantly decrease the \neffectiveness of antimicrobial agents through \ndifferent adaptations that shield one another  from \nthe toxic effects of the disinfectant, slow disinfectant \npenetration, and even prevent antimicrobial agents \nfrom reaching bacteria at the center of the biofilm, all \nof which prevent sterility from being achieved.",
  "Factors external to the organism \nSurface factors: Smooth surfaces are easier \nto disinfect while objects with rough surfaces are \nmore difficult because of the microscopic crevices \nthat can house microorganisms.  In addition, the \norganic load \u2013 the presence of organic material like \nblood or tissue \u2013 inhibits the action of disinfectants. \nA high organic load can  block neutralizing agents \nfrom reaching the surface, and biomaterial itself can \neven inactivate agents such as bleach. Proper \ncleaning with water and detergent or enzymatic \ncleaners prior to disinfection or sterilization can \nreduce \nthe \norganic \nload \nand \nincrease \nthe \neffectiveness of the disinfectant or sterilant. \nSimilarly, biofilms created by certain organisms \nprevent agent contact with the organism itself, \nthereby requiring both a longer contact time overall, \nas well as higher agent concentration.  \nAgent factors: The concentration of the \ndisinfecting agent is an important factor to consider \nwhen attempting disinfection or sterilization, as \nhigher concentrations of a chemical agent do NOT \nalways increase the microbial death rate.",
  "Agent factors: The concentration of the \ndisinfecting agent is an important factor to consider \nwhen attempting disinfection or sterilization, as \nhigher concentrations of a chemical agent do NOT \nalways increase the microbial death rate. For \nexample, a 70% isopropyl alcohol solution can kill \nmicroorganisms in seconds because water both \nallows the isopropyl alcohol to enter and penetrate \nthe entire cell and increases the contact time of the \ndisinfectant on the surface by slowing the rate of \nevaporation of the isopropyl alcohol.

The time required for disinfection is a \nfunction of bacterial load, concentration of the \ndisinfecting agent, as well as intrinsic properties of \nthe disinfecting agent.

  "For example, 70% isopropyl \nalcohol can kill Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 5 \nminutes, whereas a 3% solution of phenol requires 2-\n3 hours to achieve the same effect.  \nThe efficacy of disinfecting and sterilizing \nagents is described by their decimal reduction time \n(D-value), or death rate curve, which is the amount \nof time it takes to kill 90% of the microbial \npopulation. For example, an antimicrobial agent with \na D-value of one minute will kill 90 million cells in \na population of 100 million bacterial cells,  leaving \n10 million cells alive after one minute. However, \nafter two minutes, one million bacterial cells will still \nbe alive because this agent is known to kill 90% of \nthe bacterial cells in one minute. Therefore, \nsterilization, which requires eradication of all living \ncells, viruses, and spores, can be achieved by certain \nagents by increasing the duration of sterilization to \nseveral D-values longer than the time needed to \ntheoretically reduce the microbial population down \nto one cell.",

For example, glutaraldehyde-based \nsolutions of ~2% can achieve high-level disinfection \n(elimination of microorganisms but not spores) with \nexposure times of 12-30 minutes, but sterilization \ncan be achieved with an exposure time of 10 hours. \nProper protocols, including concentration and \nexposure time, should be carefully considered and \nadhered to when selecting the appropriate agent for \ndisinfection or sterilization. \nPhysical \nfactors: \nIn \ngeneral, \nmost \ndisinfectants work at room temperature (~20-22C), \nand, to some extent, the temperature is directly \nproportional to the activity of the disinfectant. \nCertain disinfectants require a specific pH to be \nactive, while others cannot be used together because \nthey can neutralize one another.",
  "Certain disinfectants require a specific pH to be \nactive, while others cannot be used together because \nthey can neutralize one another. Additionally, an \nagent\u2019s physical properties must be taken into \naccount. For an antimicrobial agent to effectively kill \nmicrobes at the concentration and amount of time \ndetermined by studies, the agent must remain in \ncontact with the item being disinfected for the entire \nduration of time. For example, while 70% isopropyl \nalcohol may kill M. tuberculosis in 5 minutes, if the \n70% isopropyl alcohol being used evaporates within \n30-60 seconds, then disinfection will not be \nachieved. \n \nTOOLS AND TECHNIQUES \nAs mentioned above, both the instrument \ntype and organism type must be considered when \ndetermining the best method for sterilization. \nBroadly, the techniques can be divided into physical \nmethods (heat) and chemical methods.

  "Most commercial pressure \ncookers can sterilize effectively since they can \nachieve the pressure, temperature, and time \nparameters of 15 psi, 121 oC, and 30 minutes that are \nneeded for sterilization.  Store-bought, or home \npressure cookers are relatively low-cost; however, \nmost are unable to reach the temperature and \npressure requirements needed to kill spores. One \nstudy demonstrated sterilization using an \u201cInstant \nPot,\u201d home pressure cooker, but it required a duration \nof 150 minutes to kill the spores in the test sample. \nThe extended time requirement has to be taken into \naccount when operating in low-resource settings \nwhere electricity may not be reliable. One company \nhas created a pressure cooker, the EcoClave, that can \nsterilize instruments in 30 minutes using burning \nwood as the fuel source, making it a potentially  ideal \noption for sterilization in very low resource settings \n(source.) \nWhen operating any pressure cooker, all \nmanufacturing instructions should be followed \nclosely for proper safety.
