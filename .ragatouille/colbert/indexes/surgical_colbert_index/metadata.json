        "Approach to Spinal Cord Injury \nHabib Emil Rafka, Dr. Paul Shu, and Dr. Fraser Henderson Jr. \n \nOPEN MANUAL OF SURGERY IN RESOURCE-LIMITED SETTINGS \nwww.vumc.org/global-surgical-atlas \nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License  \n \nBackground:  \nThe best outcomes from management of \ntraumatic spinal cord injury are achieved with \nexpedient and appropriate management. These \npatients, predominantly young and male, present \nafter traumatic events such as motor vehicle \ncollisions and falls. A spinal column injury might be \none aspect of poly-trauma and its management must \nbe prioritized as soon as cardiopulmonary stability is \nachieved.  \nCurrent understanding of spinal cord injury \nrecognizes both the primary injury (the trauma itself) \nand the secondary injury (damage occurring after the \ntrauma itself). Primary spinal cord injury is the initial \ndamage done to the spinal cord, most commonly due \nto physical, traumatic stress. Secondary spinal cord \ninjury is understood to occur from the delayed and \nharmful inflammatory response that can itself cause \nfurther neurological damage.",
        "Primary spinal cord injury is the initial \ndamage done to the spinal cord, most commonly due \nto physical, traumatic stress. Secondary spinal cord \ninjury is understood to occur from the delayed and \nharmful inflammatory response that can itself cause \nfurther neurological damage. Decades of research \nhave sought to block this cascade, though sadly no \ndefinitive treatment has been found. High-dose \nsteroid protocols have helped in occasional \nsituations, though clinical trials have largely \nremained disappointing. Steroid use is no longer \nstandard for spinal cord injuries in most management \nguidelines.  \nPrimary spinal cord injuries might result \nfrom impact, laceration, hyper-flexion or -extension, \nor ongoing compression. An efficient but thoughtful \nneurological exam remains critical for the managing \nsurgeon because the clinical presentation will result \nfrom the specific level and the specific part of the \nspinal cord that is involved.",
        "An efficient but thoughtful \nneurological exam remains critical for the managing \nsurgeon because the clinical presentation will result \nfrom the specific level and the specific part of the \nspinal cord that is involved. There are several \nsyndromes of paraplegia, hemiplegia, quadriplegia, \nsensory deficits, loss of bowel control, sexual \ndysfunction, and others that will be recognized by an \nastute surgeon and can localize to the level of injury. \nImaging can then confirm the diagnosis. \nBecause international guidelines generally \nassume a high-resource setting, we must often \nmodify our approach in lower resource settings. In \nthis chapter we will aim to address:  \n\u25cf Inconsistent availability of advanced imaging \n\u25cf Shortage of material resources such as cervical \nneck braces, ventilators, halo reduction vests, \nWells-Gardner tongs, etc. \n\u25cf Delayed presentation  \n\u25cf Patients without funds \n\u25cf Theater and nursing staff limitations, team \nfatigue and burnout \n \nAnatomy:  \n \nA cross-sectional image of the spinal cord, highlighting \nimportant anatomical structures."
