    "Tangential Excision of Burns\nCassidy A. Muir, Peter Stafford, Goran Jovic, Deepak K. Ozhathil\n\nIntroduction:\n\nWhere resources permit, early burn excision\nfor  deep  partial  and  full  thickness  burns  and  skin\ngrafting  is  recommended.  Tangential  excision  was\npioneered by Dr. Zora Jan\u017eekovi\u010d through her work\nwith  burn  patients  in  the  former  Yugoslavia  in  the\n1960s. Since then, it has become the standard of care\nin  resource-rich  settings  where  there  may  be  ready\naccess to blood products and general anesthesia.  In\ncontrast,  in  resource  limited  settings,  conservative\nmanagement is pursued, as this is often safer for the\npatient. This  approach consists of wound care until\nthe  burn  eschar  has  sloughed  off,\nleaving  a\ngranulating wound that can be grafted. However, in\nmany  cases  (including  the  examples  shown  in  this\nchapter)  it  is  safer  and  more  expedient  to  excise\ntissue that is clearly burned.",
    "Burn wounds can be excised  in a tangential\nor fascial manner.  Tangential excision is performed\nmost  often  and  involves  sequential  excision  of\nburned tissue until viable tissue is reached.  This can\nbe  done  with  a  number  of  different  surgical\ninstruments.    Most  commonly,  sharp  excision  is\nperformed  with  the  Watson  knife  or  the  Goulian-\nWeck blade. Progenitors of these instruments such as\nthe Rosenburg, Thiersch, and Humby knives are still\nused at some institutions.  Powered dermatomes such\nas  a  Padgett-Hood  or  Brown  dermatomes  or\nAmalgatome  can  be  used,  as  well  as  hydrosurgical\ndissection  using  a  VersaJet,  or  mechanical\ndebridement  using  a  TPS  Dermabrader.  The  latter\ntechniques are especially useful on highly contoured\nsurfaces such as the face and hands.",
    "Full  fascial  excision  removes  skin  and\nsubcutaneous  tissue  en-bloc  down  to  the  anterior\nis  usually  performed  with\nfascial  plane  and\ndiathermy  or  in  combination  with  sharp  dissection.\nThis technique is reserved for deep, large, or severely\nand invasively infected burns where patients would\nnot  tolerate  the  extensive  blood  loss  of  tangential\nexcision.  Fascial  excision\nis  associated  with\nlymphedema  and  contour  deformities  leading  to\nworse functional and cosmetic outcomes.\n\nFull fascial excision removes burned tissue down to the fascia\nunderneath,  usually  performed  with  diathermy  or  a  scalpel\nblade.

The patient may\nbe positioned supine, lateral decubitus, or prone\nas  needed  to  perform  the  surgery.    At  times,  it\nmay  be  necessary  to  reposition  the  patient\nintraoperatively to access the necessary sites for\nexcision and grafting.",
    "Uninvolved  areas  should  be  covered  with\nblankets and involved areas may be temporarily\ncovered with a surgical drape or a fluid warmer\ncover.  For large surface area burns, a tremendous\namount of heat can be lost from the patient during\nthe surgery. Therefore, it is essential to pre-warm\nthe operating theater prior to surgery, make every\neffort to minimize unnecessary heat loss from the\nroom,  and  closely  monitor\nthe  patient\u2019s\ntemperature throughout the case. If the patient\u2019s\ntemperature  deteriorates  during  the  surgery,  the\nsurgeon  should  limit  the  extent  of  excision  and\nstaging  operative  goals  over  multiple  surgeries,\ngiving time to rewarm and resuscitate the patient.\n4.  A major limitation of tangential excision is blood\nloss, and it is important to take steps to minimize\nsurgical blood loss.

The\nfocus  becomes  on  controlling  the  bleeding  or\neliminating  the  source  of  sepsis  and  getting  the\npatient  to  the  ICU  for  further  resuscitation  and\nrewarming.

If abdominal compartment syndrome seems\nlikely,  ask  the  anesthetist  what  is  the  peak  airway\npressure (at the end of inspiration) at the beginning\nof closure and then check it again at the end. If the\npressure  rises  by  more  than  15cm  H20  after\nabdominal closure, consider reopening and applying\na  temporary  closure  device,  especially  if  the  blood\npressure has dropped during closure as well.\n\nRegardless  of\n\ntechnique  used",

    "Intestinal Anastomosis\nRichard Davis\n\nIntroduction:\n\nIn this chapter we present one technique for a\nhand-sewn bowel anastomosis. There are many ways\nto  anastomose  bowel  using  sutures,  staples,  or  a\ncombination of the two. All successful anastomoses\nwill  involve  well  vascularized  tissue,  under  no\ntension, with the bowel being inverted, or folded into\nitself. Our technique is easy to learn, easy to teach,\nand  relatively  safe  even  in  inexperienced  hands.\nPlease  note  as  you  review  the  pictures  that  this\ntechnique assumes both surgeons sew the inner layer\nby passing the needle from their left to their right.\n\nThis  is  the  same  two  layered  technique  we\nuse  for  Billroth  1  gastroduodenostomy  after  partial\ngastrectomy,  see  that  chapter  for  more  photos  and\nexplanation of the technique.\n\nTwo layer, hand sewn intestinal anastomosis\n\nproceeds according to the following steps:\n\u25cf  Alignment  of  the  two  pieces  of  bowel  with\n\ntraction sutures",

The two ends of the bowel should not be kinked\nor twisted- this can be confirmed by aligning the\nmesenteries  of  both  segments.  The  two  ends\nshould  meet  with  absolutely  no\ntension.\nEspecially  when  anastomosing  the  colon,  we\nprefer  to  see  and  feel  a  pulsatile  vessel  in  the\nmesentery immediately adjacent to the cut edge\nof the bowel. Place a traction suture through the\nserosa and muscular layer of the mesenteric and\nantimesenteric  sides  of  the  bowel  to  align  it.  If\npossible,  it  should  be  aligned  so  that  the\nanastomosis  will  be  in  a  line  between  the  two\noperators, as shown below:",

    "Split Thickness Skin Graft\nRichard Davis, Vallery Logedi\n\nIntroduction:\n\nSplit  thickness  skin  graft  is  a  useful  way  to\ncover  wounds  that  have  no  living  epidermal  cells,\nsuch as deep abrasions, burns, venous stasis ulcers,\nand  sites  of  tumor  excision.  It  is  a  good  option  for\ncovering even  large wounds, as split thickness skin\ncan be expanded to cover more space than the area it\ncame from, through the process of \u201cmeshing\u201d which\nis described further below. Skin grafts, either split or\nfull thickness, are not useful for pressure ulcers; an\noption that is more tolerant of pressure must be used\nin this situation.",
    "Split  thickness  grafts  can  be  harvested  in\nvarious  thicknesses,  as  discussed  further  below.\nEvery  split  thickness  graft  will  contract  after  being\nplaced; the thinner a graft is, the more it will contract.\nConversely,  the  thicker  a  graft  is,  the  less  it  will\ncontract, and the stronger and more resistant it is to\ntrauma. The strength of increased thickness comes at\nthe price of a slightly higher chance that the graft will\nnot \u201ctake,\u201d or successfully implant at the graft site.\nIt is acceptable to use split thickness grafts on\nthe face in certain situations, although in general they\nshould  be  avoided  because  of  their  tendency  to\ncontract. When used on the face, they should be thick\nand not \u201cmeshed\u201d because of the cosmetic effects of\ndoing so.\n\nA  skin  graft  can  be",
    "A  skin  graft  can  be\n\nthought  of  as\ntransplantation  of  living  epidermal  cells  from  one\nlocation  to  another.  Therefore,  the  surgeon  must\nassure  that  there  are  sufficient  epidermal  cells\nremaining at the donor site after harvest, and that the\nrecipient site will support these newly arrived cells\nafter their transplantation.",
    "To assure that living cells remain at the donor\nsite after harvest, the graft must be taken at a depth\nthat is less than the hair follicles. The donor site will\nre-epithelialize by migration of these cells, from the\nhair  follicles,  into  the  rest  of  the  wound.  Hair\nfollicles\u2019 depth is variable depending on the part of\nthe body, but in general they are located at about 2-\n3mm of depth. So the dermatome, whether manual or\nmechanical, must be set  to a depth to leave  a good\ndeal  of  the  hair  follicle  behind.  Most  skin  grafts\nharvest  skin  around  0.3-0.5mm  deep.  It  is  the\nsurgeon\u2019s  responsibility  to  make  sure  that  the\ndermatome is set properly and remains so, harvesting\nneither to little nor too much skin. A dermatome that\ncuts too deep will result in a non-healing wound at\nthe donor site, as there will be no viable epidermal\ncells remaining there.",

As mentioned earlier, harvesting too\nmuch skin at the donor site might result in a non-\nhealing wound that will also need grafting!\n\u25cf  It is important that adequate tension is applied at\nthe donor site during harvesting as this is key to\nhow the dermatome works.

If  the\nskin from one thigh might not be enough, it may\nbe  prudent  to  prepare  both  lower  limbs  and  the\nabdomen  just  in  case,  rather  than  to  run  out  of\nspace to harvest skin.\n\n\u25cf  Failure to correct the factors that led to the wound\nwill lead to graft failure.

    "Trans-Rectal Drainage of Pelvic Abscess\nRichard Davis\n\nIntroduction:\n\nabscess  drainage  performed  by\n\nTrans-rectal  drainage  of  an  abscess  in  the\npelvis, performed by a surgeon in the operating room,\nwas once a very common technique for dealing with\npelvic  abscesses.  In  resource-rich  settings,  this\ntechnique has been largely replaced by image-guided\npelvic\nan\ninterventional  radiologist.  It  remains  important  in\nsettings like ours, however: it can help you avoid a\nlaparotomy  and  its  attendant  risks.  It  is  especially\nuseful  in  a  patient  who  develops  a  pelvic  abscess\nafter  a  laparotomy  for  peritoneal  sepsis,  a  not\nuncommon event. The procedure can also easily be\nadapted to a trans-vaginal approach if the abscess can\nbe more easily reached in this manner.",
    "As mentioned above, a common indication is\ndevelopment of a pelvic abscess after laparotomy for\nabdominal  sepsis.  Other  indications  include  pelvic\ninflammatory  disease  with  abscess  that  has  not\nresponded  to  antibiotics,  or  conditions  such  as\nperforated appendicitis that lead to an abscess in the\npelvis.  On  rare  occasions,  a  perianal  abscess  will\ndrain \u201cupwards\u201d and create an abscess in the pelvis,\nin  the  supralevator  space.  Usually  such  an  abscess\nwill also have a perianal component that you can feel\nwhen  palpating  the  perineum.  If  not,  this  diagnosis\ncan be extremely difficult to make without a CT scan.\nWhen  trans-rectal  drainage  of  an  abscess  is\nperformed in resource-rich settings, the technique is\nas  follows:  a  needle  is  inserted  into  the  abscess,\nfollowed by passage of a guidewire, dilation of  the\ntract, and placement of a catheter in the abscess. If\nyou  have  access  to  a  guidewire  and  a  small  pigtail",
    "followed by passage of a guidewire, dilation of  the\ntract, and placement of a catheter in the abscess. If\nyou  have  access  to  a  guidewire  and  a  small  pigtail\ncatheter,  you  can  adapt  the  techniques  described  in\nthis chapter to drain the abscess using these items.",
    "There  are  three  big  limitations  to  this\n\ntechnique.\n\u2022  You  must  be  certain  of  the  abscess\u2019s  location.\nOften,  but  not  always,  this  requires  a  CT  scan,\ninexperienced  clinician.\nespecially\nHowever,  if  the  clinical  scenario,  physical\nexamination and pelvic ultrasound all fit, a CT is\nnot necessary.

That is, it must be\nfreely\n\ncontained,\n\nwalled\n\nand\n\nnot\n\noff\n\ncommunicating with the peritoneum. If it is not\ncontained,  making  a  hole  in  the  rectum  that\ncommunicates with the peritoneal cavity will not\nmake the patient better, it will make them much\nworse. Usually it takes 4-5 days for an abscess in\nthe abdomen  to be walled off. On CT scan,  the\nfinding of \u201crim enhancement,\u201d the uptake of IV\ncontrast by the inflammatory wall of the abscess,\nconfirms this fact.",

    "Latissimus Dorsi Flap\nRichard Davis, Geoffrey Hallock, Yoko Young Sang\n\nIntroduction:\n\nThe Latissimus Dorsi (LD) flap is a versatile\nmuscular or musculocutaneous flap that can be used\nto cover defects in a wide area that spans the anterior\nchest,  axilla,  shoulder,  anterior  and  lateral  neck,\nthoracic  spine,  and  even  the  oral  cavity  and\noropharynx.  It  is  robust,  meaning  that  it  can\nsuccessfully  be  used  by  \u201coccasional\u201d  plastic\nsurgeons. Its primary neurovascular pedicle is easy\nto find and to preserve during harvest.",
    "The LD is a fan-shaped muscle about 30 cm\nin length, originating from the spinous processes of\nT7-L5 vertebrae, the 7th to 12th ribs, and the posterior\nsuperior iliac spine. It inserts on the medial aspect of\nthe  head  of  the  humerus,  between  the  insertions  of\nthe  teres  major  and  pectoralis  major  muscles.  It\nfunctions  to  adduct  and  internally  rotate  the  upper\narm,  as  well  as  to  support  the  trunk.  In  its  absence\narm adduction is weakened and the back symmetry\nthe\nIts  primary  vascular  supply\nis\nthoracodorsal artery and vein, which originate off the\n3rd portion of the subclavian vessels. Its nerve supply\nis the thoracodorsal nerve, which runs with the artery\nand vein.\n\nlost.\n\nis",
    "lost.\n\nis\n\nThe standard LD flap is created by detaching\nthe fan-shaped portion of the muscle from the chest\nwall,  often  including  some  of  the  overlying  skin.\nWhen  completely  detached  up  to  the  axilla,  it  can\nprovide soft tissue coverage in a range up to about\n30cm  from  the  head  of  the  humerus.  This  area\nencompasses  the  upper  arm,  axilla,  breast  and\nanterior  chest  wall,  anterior  and  lateral  neck,  and\neven the floor of mouth, cheek, or oropharynx.\n\nAlthough  the  LD  flap  will  easily  reach  the\noral  cavity  and  even  the  temporal  region  or  skull\nbase,  it  is  not  commonly  used  in  head  and  neck\nreconstruction. This is because the volume of muscle\nadds  bulk wherever it is placed, and there are other\neasier and less morbid flap options in the head and\nneck, described elsewhere in this Manual.",
    "The  LD  flap  is  most  commonly  used  for\nreconstruction  of  chest  wall  defects,  reconstruction\nafter  mastectomy,  and  closure  of  defects  on  the\nanterior or lateral neck if a large amount of tissue is\nneeded.  This  flap  can  be  transferred  with  muscle\nalone, without a skin paddle.\n\nThe  latissimus  dorsi  (Red  Arrow)  is  a  long,  flat,  fan-shaped\nmuscle  which  can  be  rotated  around\nits\nthoracodorsal vascular pedicle, with or without division of the\nmuscle near to its insertion on the humerus.\n\nthe  axis  of\n\nFor deeply scarred burn contractures, a musculocutaneous flap\nprovides  a  superior  result  compared  to  a  full  thickness  skin\ngraft. Additionally, a neck brace is not required during healing,\nas it would be with a skin graft to prevent a recurrence of the\ncontracture.\n\nOPEN MANUAL OF SURGERY IN RESOURCE-LIMITED SETTINGS\nwww.vumc.org/global-surgical-atlas\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License",

LD flap\nclosure is reserved for those tumors which remain too\nlarge for primary closure after chemotherapy, or for\ndebulking  of\nto\nchemotherapy at all. The surgeon should be careful\nto assess the axilla, as a high lymph node burden will\nmake  harvesting  this  flap  impossible.  Decision-\nmaking is discussed further in the \u201cMalignant Breast\nDisease\u201d Section.\n\nthat  do  not  respond\n\ntumors\n\nflap is harvested, and the mastectomy defect\nis closed with the flap in this position.",

The  axilla  should  be  examined\ncarefully,  as  axillary  adenopathy  will  make\ncomplete  mobilization  of  the  flap  very  difficult\nor impossible.\n\nThis patient underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy for locally\ninvasive breast cancer.

    "The main disadvantage of the LD flap is that\nit  requires  the  lateral  decubitus  position  to  harvest.\n(See Lateral Decubitus Position.) When it is used to\ncover a defect in the anterior chest wall or neck, the\npatient  must  often  be  repositioned.  In  most\nsituations,  the  tumor  is  first  removed  in  supine\nposition, the defect is measured, and then the patient\nis  placed  in  the  lateral  decubitus  position  and  the\nsurgeon harvests the flap.

As  a  country  advances\neconomically however, penetration of hemodialysis\nwill increase. The surgeon will be called on to place\ntemporary  or  permanent  dialysis  catheters  and  to\ncreate arteriovenous fistulas.\n\nThe  basic  principle  of  an  arteriovenous\nfistula  is  this:  when  a  vein  is  subjected  to  arterial\nblood flow, it dilates and its wall becomes thickened.\nSuch  a  fistula  should  have  enough  blood  flow  to\npermit  rapid  withdrawal  and  replacement  of  blood\n(350-800mL/minute.)  The\nduring  hemodialysis\nthickened  walls  are  able  to  withstand  repeated\nvenipuncture.  If  such  a  vein  is  near  enough  to  the\nskin,  it  can  be  repeatedly  accessed  by  a  non-\nphysician for hemodialysis.

It  is  covered  by  the  bicipital  aponeurosis,  a  band  of\nfibrous tissue that runs between the biceps and the pronators\nand flexors of the wrist. This structure must be divided to access\nthe artery at the level of the elbow.  Though the median nerve\nruns just medial to the artery, it is most often not seen during\nfistula surgery. Injury to this structure is unlikely with careful\ndissection.

    "Section: Arteriovenous Fistula Planning and Decision-Making\nJerry Svoboda, Richard Davis\n\nPrinciples:\n\nThere  are\n\ntwo  possibilities  for  fistula\ncreation: Arteriovenous fistula, the direct connection\nof  a  vein  to  an  artery,  and  arteriovenous  graft,  the\nconnection  of  an  artery  to  a  vein  by  a  prosthetic\nconduit.  The  prosthetic  material,  if  used,  is  usually\npolytetrafluoroethylene  (PTFE,  various  brands.)\nFistulas  are  most  commonly  connected  end-vein  to\nside-artery.  Grafts  are  connected  end-graft  to  side-\nartery  and  side-vein.  When  used,  the  graft  is\nconfigured  either  straight  in  the  forearm  or  upper\narm, or as a loop in the forearm. Infection of the graft\nmandates  removal,  but  it  is  unclear  whether  such\ninfections occur more frequently in resource-limited\nsettings such as ours.\n\nArteriovenous fistulae are generally placed in",
    "four common locations:\n\u25cf  Distal  radial-cephalic:  the  end  of  the  cephalic\nvein  is  anastomosed  to  the  side  of  the  radial\nartery  at  the  wrist.  This  fistula  has  perhaps  the\nlowest  success  rate  of  all  due  to  the  frequently\nsmall  size  of  the  vein  here.  However,  it  can  be\ndone under local anesthesia and if it fails, another\nfistula can be attempted more proximally in the\narm.  The  converse  is  not  true:  if  a  proximal\nfistula has failed, a more distal one is unlikely to\nsucceed. Another advantage to this fistula is that\nin >95% of patients, the hand will remain viable\neven if the radial artery is irreversibly damaged\nthrough  surgical  misadventure,  because  of  the\nulnar artery and the palmar arch. Similarly, \u201csteal\nsyndrome,\u201d the loss of perfusion to the distal arm\ndue to excessive flow through the fistula, occurs\nonly  rarely.  Creation  of  a  wrist  level  AVF  is\nadvised  if  the  vein  is  adequate,  as  patients  on",
    "due to excessive flow through the fistula, occurs\nonly  rarely.  Creation  of  a  wrist  level  AVF  is\nadvised  if  the  vein  is  adequate,  as  patients  on\nlong-term dialysis need as many possible fistula\nsites preserved as possible.",
    "\u25cf  Proximal radial-cephalic: the end of the cephalic\nvein  is  anastomosed  to  the  side  of  the  radial\nartery in the forearm. This operation is practical\nup to the mid-forearm, though the radial artery is\ndeeper  than  at  the  wrist.  It  is  a  useful  option  if\nveins in this area are large, and it does not prevent\na  fistula  based  on  the  brachial  artery  later.  The\nadvantages  of  radial  artery  fistula  described\nabove also apply here.\n\n\u25cf  Brachial-cephalic:  The  end  of  the  cephalic  or\nlateral antebrachial cutaneous vein is attached to\n\nthe side of the brachial artery. This operation is\ntechnically  easy  to  perform;  all  the  vessels\ninvolved are relatively large and superficial. The\nmajor  disadvantage  is  the  potential  for  steal\nsyndrome.  Patients  may  experience  coldness,\nnumbness, or severe pain, either during dialysis\nor  during  use  of  the  hand.  This  complication  is\nbest  prevented  by  limiting  the  size  of  the\narteriotomy to 6mm.",
    "\u25cf  Brachial-basilic:  The  end  of  the  basilic  vein  is\nattached  to  the  side  of  the  brachial  artery.  The\nbasilic vein runs deep to the fascia of the upper\narm and is therefore unsuitable as a fistula unless\nit  is  superficialized.  This  is  commonly  done  by\ndissecting it out along its length from the elbow\nto  the  axilla,  and  then  transposing  it  to  the\nanterior  midline  of  the  upper  arm,  where  it  is\nmore  accessible  for  dialysis.  This  transposition\ncan be done in one or two stages, as described in\nthe Chapter on this operation.\n\nDecision Making:",
    "Decision Making:\n\nThe  surgeon  must  evaluate  the  patient  very\ncarefully and select a location where the fistula has\nthe  best  chance  of  success.  The  patient  should\nunderstand that fistulas are generally not permanent,\nso  part  of  the  planning  includes  considering  future\nfistula locations and the  effect that any present one\nwill have. The following general principles apply:\n\u25cf  Patients  will  generally  prefer  a  fistula  on  their\nnon-dominant  arm,  though  the  surgeon  should\nprefer this side only if the veins and arteries are\nof otherwise equal quality on both sides.\n\n\u25cf  The surgeon should consider the position that the\narm will be in during dialysis; even a paralyzed\nor  contracted  arm  is  acceptable  as  long  as  a\nfistula on it can be accessed while the patient is\nseated comfortably.",
    "\u25cf  Fistulas will generally have at least a 10% initial\nfailure rate, even if made perfectly with excellent\nquality vessels. The most meticulous attention to\ndetail  is  needed  to  assure  the  highest  chance  of\nsuccess!\n\n\u25cf  When  a  distal  fistula  fails,  one  can  be  placed\nmore  proximally.

Fuel sources in the\noperating  theater  include  alcohol-based  solutions,\ndrapes and gowns, blankets, dressings, gauze, airway\nequipment,  etc.  Oxidizers  found  in  the  operating\ntheater  include  oxygen  and  nitrous  oxide.  Lastly,\nignition  sources  include  diathermy,  lasers,  drills,\nfiber  optic  light  sources  (e.g.  for  laparoscopic\nsurgery,) or malfunctioning electrical equipment.",
    "Fire prevention in the operating theater starts\nwith  reducing  all  aspects  of  the  fire  triangle.  This\ninvolves  minimizing  an  oxidizing  source,  safely\nmanaging  fuel  sources,  and  ensuring  that  ignition\nsources  are  well  controlled.  Risky  surgeries  should\nbe  identified  ahead  of  time  and  a  fire  management\nplan should be discussed with the entire theater team.\nA  multidisciplinary  fire  prevention  team  with  an\nestablished protocol is crucial to not only prevent but\nalso manage intraoperative fires. If a fire does occur,\ninvolved  should  debrief  and  revisit\npersonnel\nhospital  established  protocols.    An  example  of  a\nprotocol can be found at the end of this chapter.\n\nAirway fires during ear, nose & throat (ENT)\noperations  can  be  mitigated  by  decreasing  FiO2  to\nless than 30%, using appropriate endotracheal tubes\nif  electrocautery  or  lasers  are  being  used,  and  an\nappropriate airway fire safety plan.",

At least 30 minutes is required\nif the patient\u2019s hair is prepped into the surgical field.\nAccess to a CO2 fire extinguisher is necessary\nfor all operating theaters. Fire extinguishers must be\nchecked yearly for adequate pressure.\n\nRadiation Safety\n\nThe  \u201cFire  Triangle\u201d  shows  the  three  elements  needed  for\ncombustion: Fuel, an Oxidizer, and Ignition.

For early stage (T1 or\nTis)  rectal  tumors  without  high-risk  features,  or\nrectal polyps unable to be removed endoscopically,\nlocal  transanal  excision  is  the  preferred  surgical\napproach.",

For T1 tumors,\noverall  and  local  recurrence  at  5  years  remains\nslightly  higher  than  following  a  total  mesorectal\nexcision,  but  this  risk  increases  significantly  with\nlesions > 3 cm or > T1 stage.",
    "Tumors or lesions within the middle to distal\nrectum are often accessible via a transanal approach,\nthough more proximal lesions may require a formal\nresection,  such  as  a  low  anterior  resection  of  the\nrectum.  Transanal  excision  is  not  recommended\nabove  the  peritoneal  reflection  as  a  full  thickness\nexcision may result in entry into the peritoneal cavity.\nMuch  of  the  success  of  local  resection  is\ndependent  on  patient  positioning  and  instrument\nselection.

The  proximal  ureter  is  fed  by  the\nrenal  artery;  the  mid  ureter  has  a  variable  supply\nincluding  the  gonadal  vessels,  aorta,  and  the  iliac\nvessels; and the distal ureter relies on supply from the\nsuperior and inferior vesical arteries off the internal\niliac. These larger arteries feed subsequently smaller\nbranches  which  anastomose  within  the  fibrous\nadventitia  of  the  ureter  along  its  entire  length.\nTherefore, while loss of any single large vessel will\nnot  necessarily  devitalize  the  entire  ureter,  careful\ntissue  handling  of  the  ureter  and  its  adventitia  is\nessential to avoid damage to these small vessels.

This should be done, at a\nminimum, with a ureteral stent and can be augmented\nwith a foley catheter to reduce urine reflux along the\ntube  for  proximal\nstent.  Add  a  nephrostomy\ndecompression  when  a  repair  is  considered  at  high\nrisk of failing. In settings where a ureteral stent is not\navailable,  ureteral  repair  without  a  stent  can  be\nperformed; however, there is likely a higher risk of\nleak  and/or  stricture  formation.  If  upper  tract\ndrainage is not available with either a nephrostomy\ntube  or  a  stent,  we  would  recommend  extended\nretroperitoneal drainage with a closed suction drain\nto minimize risk of urinoma formation and infection.\n\nDecision Making:\nThe Unstable Patient:\n\nthe  understanding\n\nThe  first  consideration",

When nephrostomy\ntube placement is not feasible or available, drainage\nmay  be  achieved  in  one  of  two  ways.  First,  the\nproximal  ureter  can  be  brought  to  the  skin  and\nmatured as a cutaneous ureterostomy, ideally with an\nindwelling stent. Alternatively, a single-J or double-\nJ  stent  can  be  placed  into  the  proximal  ureter  and\nrenal  pelvis  and  secured  with  a  non-absorbable\nsuture, with the other  end then brought  through the\nskin as a drain to allow temporary urinary drainage.\nFinally,  if  patient  stability  does  not  allow  for  even",

In  general,  other  intra-abdominal  injuries\nshould  not  preclude  reconstruction  for  the  stable\npatient.  However,  long  mid-to-proximal  ureteral\ninjuries that would require extensive reconstruction,\nsuch as a creation of an ileal ureter, are generally not\npreferable  in  the  acute  setting  and  should  be\npostponed for a later procedure.",
    "As  previously  stated,  the  location  of  the\ninjury  guides  the  repair.  Distal  injuries  are  best\nreimplanted  into  the  bladder  due  to  the  detrusor\nmuscle\u2019s  robust  blood  supply  from  the  bilateral\nsuperior  and  inferior  vesical  arteries.  This  blood\nsupply also directly feeds the distal ureter and is ideal\nfor anastomotic healing and responsible for the low\nrate of ureteroneocystostomy strictures. The bladder\ncan be mobilized using a psoas hitch with or without\na  Boari  flap  in  order  to  bridge  the  gap  to  healthy\nureter. These strategies can make even mid-ureteral\ninjuries re-implantable into the bladder. For injuries\nthat  are  too  proximal  for  even  aggressive  bladder\nuretero-\nmobilization\nureterostomy should be performed.

There  is  a  slight  increase  in  cancer\npotential in undescended testis, but this risk does not\ndecrease  after  orchidopexy.  However,  testicular\ncancer  is  easier  to  detect,  by  palpation,  in  testes\nlocated within the scrotum. Orchidopexy at 8 months\nto  one  year  of  time  is  recommended  for  fertility\npreservation, potential cancer detection, and to avoid\ntraumatic  injury  to  a  testis  located  over  boney\nstructures.",

It is seen by the ultrasound, including the\ntip which can be seen as it advances.\n\nIn  general,  any  probe  can  be  used  for  an\nultrasound-guided intervention. However, the depth\nof the structure in question determines which probe\nshould  be  used.  The  linear  (vascular)  transducer,\nwith  frequencies  of  5  -  7.5mHz,  shows  detail  at\ndepths  up  to  6  cm  and  should  be  used  for  venous\ncatheterization. It can also be used for breast or neck\nmass  biopsy.  The  curved  (abdominal)  transducer,\nwith frequencies of 2.5 - 3mHz, shows detail up to\n18cm.  This  should  be  used  for  drainage  of  intra-\nabdominal abscess or liver biopsy.\n\nIt\n\nis\n\nimportant",

If the needle is completely within\nthe flat plane of tissue beneath the probe, all of it will\nbe seen. If the needle merely passes through the plane\nof tissue in one place, it will be seen as only a dot. If\nthe needle is parallel to, but not passing through, the\nplane of the tissue underneath the probe, it will not\nbe  seen  at  all.  These  last  two  situations  should  be\navoided as much as possible, because the sharp tip of\nthe needle is unseen by the operator.",

The images are then used as a\nreference for surgical planning; probe placement can\nbe guided by palpable landmarks such as the costal\nmargin  or  the  iliac  crest.  If  CT  is  unavailable,  the\nsurgeon  must  use  fixed  intra-abdominal  landmarks\nfor reference while examining the anatomy with the\nultrasound  probe.  Landmarks  include  the  liver,  the\nkidneys,  the  diaphragm,  the  bladder  (or  the  Foley\ncatheter balloon) and the retroperitoneal vessels. The\nbowels themselves, being compressible and mobile,\nare not useful as landmarks.",
    "The  most  feared  complication  of  any\nultrasound-guided intervention is iatrogenic injury to\nsurrounding structures. In the neck, the vessels of the\ncarotid sheath as well as the trachea and esophagus\nare at risk. In the abdomen, the operator must avoid\ninjury to the bowels, the great vessels, and the larger\nvessels  within  the  liver.  In  general,  the  liver  is  a\nfriend  to  the  interventionist,  because  it  is  easy  to\nvisualize and relatively safe to pass a needle through.\nDrainage of subphrenic or para-duodenal abscesses,\nas well as percutaneous cholecystostomy, all involve\npassing  a  needle  through  the  liver  to  get  to  the\npathology.

We  have  developed  the  following\ntechnique for teaching this skill, using pieces of soft\nfruit suspended in gelatin.\n\nWe usually have ultrasound practice sessions\nof 1-2 hours each, with about 3-4 stations.

Obtain  packets  of  gelatin,  either  plain  or\n\nflavored, as available.\n\nAn example of gelatin available in a local market.\n\n2.  Obtain a bowl with a round shape.

    "Midline Abdominal Incision\nRichard Davis\n\nIntroduction:\n\nThe midline abdominal incision is by far the\nmost commonly used incision in abdominal surgery.\nIt allows rapid access to all the abdominal cavity. It\nis  extensible  if  access  is  limited  or  if  unexpected\nfindings  prompt  a  change  in  strategy.  It  does  not\nrequire  a  muscle  to  be  split  and  therefore  it  can  be\nclosed rapidly, in one layer.\n\nAn understanding of the midline incision and\nall  of  its  variations  is  part  of  the  foundation  of\nabdominal surgery. The incision and closure proceed\nin the following general steps:\n\u25cf  Skin incision and division of the subcutaneous fat\n\u25cf  Division of the linea alba\n\u25cf  Dissection of the preperitoneal space\n\u25cf  Division of the peritoneum\n\u25cf  Intra-abdominal intervention\n\u25cf  Closure, beginning separately at each end of the\n\nincision and meeting in the middle\n\n\u25cf  Skin closure",
    "incision and meeting in the middle\n\n\u25cf  Skin closure\n\nSteps:\n1.  The surgeon generally stands opposite the side of\nexpected  pathology.  For  pelvic  surgery,  the\nsurgeon  stands  on  the  side  that  will  allow  the\ndominant hand to have direct access to the pelvis.\n2.  The  area  of  planned  incision  is  marked,  if\ndesired. If there is any possibility of an ostomy,\ncurve  the  incision  to  the  opposite  side  of  the\numbilicus\n\nThe planned incision can be marked by gently scratching the\nskin with an instrument. This step is not mandatory.\n\n3.  Incise the skin with a scalpel, down to the level\n\nof the dermis or subcutaneous tissue.\n\nIncision of the skin through the epidermis alone allows better\nhemostasis,  as  the  dermis  with  its  blood  vessels  can  now  be\ndivided with diathermy.\n\nOPEN MANUAL OF SURGERY IN RESOURCE-LIMITED SETTINGS\n www.vumc.org/global-surgical-atlas\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License",

    "Cricothyroidotomy\nRichard Davis\n\nIntroduction:\n\nCricothyroidotomy (also called cricothyrotomy)\nis an emergency airway procedure that is done when\nother  attempts  to  secure  a  definitive  airway  have\nfailed.  The  situation  may  be  trauma,  upper  airway\nneoplasm,  severe  infection  compressing  the  upper\nairway, or excessive secretions or debris that cannot\nbe cleared in a timely manner.  Recall from Airway\nManagement in Trauma that a definitive airway is a\ncuffed  endotracheal  tube,  with  the  cuff  inflated,  in\nthe trachea below the vocal cords.\n\nthe  airway  through\n\nCricothyroidotomy accomplishes this goal by\naccessing\nthe  cricothyroid\nmembrane,  immediately  below  the  vocal  cords.\nTherefore, it is possible to damage the vocal cords if\ncarelessly.

    "Trans-Urethral Resection of Bladder Tumor\nEmma Bryant, Gabrielle Yankelevich\n\nIntroduction:\n\nTransurethral resection of bladder tumor is a\nminimally invasive strategy to remove lesions of the\nbladder wall. It is both a therapeutic and diagnostic\ntool.  A  resectoscope  is  utilized  to  complete  the\nresection; this tool uses electricity to both coagulate\ntissue and resect it. It consists of a sheath, lens, and\nworking element (monopolar or bipolar electrode) as\nexplained  further  below.  Conventionally,  bladder\ntumor  resection  is  performed  using  a  monopolar\nthe\nresectoscope.  The  current,  generated  by\ndiathermy  machine,  passes  from  the  electrode\nthrough  the  patient\u2019s  body  to  terminate  at  an\nelectrode on the skin (grounding pad). This approach\nrequires  non-ionizing  conduction  fluid,  such  as\nglycine or sorbitol.",
    "Ideally the irrigation solution is iso-osmotic,\nbut by design it will contain less sodium and chloride\nions than the patient\u2019s bloodstream does. This leads\nto a risk of post-operative Trans- Urethral Resection\n(TUR) syndrome. This is a serious complication due\nirrigation  solution,\nto  excessive  absorption  of\ncausing  hyponatremia  which  can  lead  seizures  and\ndeath. To prevent TUR syndrome, limit resections to\n1 hour. Water can also be used for irrigation, but it is\nboth  hypotonic  and  hypo-osmotic,  so  the  patient\u2019s\nserum sodium and osmolality will drop rapidly.\n\nIn\n\nsettings,\n\nhigh-resource\n\nbipolar\nto\nresectoscopes  are  more  commonly  utilized\nmitigate  this  risk.  A  bipolar  working  element  uses\nboth  efferent  and  afferent  currents,  so  an  external\nelectrode  (grounding  pad)  is  not  necessary.  Saline\nirrigation is used for bipolar resections.",

Primary spinal cord injury is the initial\ndamage done to the spinal cord, most commonly due\nto physical,  traumatic stress. Secondary spinal cord\ninjury  is  understood  to  occur  from  the  delayed  and\nharmful inflammatory response that can itself cause\nfurther  neurological  damage.  Decades  of  research\nhave  sought  to  block  this  cascade,  though  sadly  no\ndefinitive  treatment  has  been  found.  High-dose\nin  occasional\nsteroid  protocols  have  helped\nsituations,\nlargely\nremained  disappointing.  Steroid  use  is  no  longer\nstandard for spinal cord injuries in most management\nguidelines.\n\nthough  clinical\n\ntrials  have",

There  are  several\nsyndromes  of  paraplegia,  hemiplegia,  quadriplegia,\nsensory  deficits,  loss  of  bowel  control,  sexual\ndysfunction, and others that will be recognized by an\nastute surgeon and can localize to the level of injury.\nImaging can then confirm the diagnosis.",

    "Tracheostomy\nRichard Davis and Joseph Nderitu\n\nIntroduction:\n\nThe general indications for tracheostomy are\nprolonged  orotracheal  intubation  and  conditions  in\nthe upper airway  that do not support a safe airway.\nThese include tumors, severe soft tissue infections or\ntrauma, and some surgical interventions.\n\nSome  surgeons  prefer  to  perform  open\ntracheostomy  through  a  small  incision,  hoping  to\nmaximize  the  cosmetic  appearance  of  the  resulting\nscar. We disagree: a tracheostomy scar never looks\ntube  removal.  The  poor  cosmetic\ngood  after\nappearance  is not due to the length of the incision,\nbut to the tube passing through it. By using a slightly\nwider  incision,  the  surgeon  can  safely  achieve\nhemostasis  and  take  measures  to  avoid  excessive\nbleeding  or  tracheal  stenosis,  which  we  describe\nfurther below.",
    "Some  patients  with  airway  obstruction  are\nable  to  maintain  an  airway  while  awake  but\norotracheal or nasotracheal intubation is impossible.\nOne  example  is  a  patient  presenting  with  a  near-\nobstructing  laryngeal  tumor  who  is  still  able  to\nbreathe,  but  with  difficulty.  These  patients  will\nrequire  awake  tracheostomy,  a  challenging  but  not\nimpossible  procedure.    This  operation  can  be  done\nexactly  as  described  below,  with  frequent  and\ncopious injection of local anesthetic.\n\nTracheostomy  is  never  a  suitable  procedure\nfor  emergency  airway  access;  cricothyroidotomy  is\nmuch more appropriate in this situation. An obvious\nexception to this rule is an open neck injury with an\nexposed  trachea,  such  as  a  \u201cclothesline\u201d  injury.\nCricothyroidotomy is described in a separate chapter.\nTracheostomy  proceeds  in  the  following\n\ngeneral steps:\n\u25cf  Incision  of  the  skin  and  superficial  layer  of  the\n\ndeep cervical fascia",

Risks to the\n(infections,\nshort\nmother\nthromboembolism,  surgical  risk,  death)  and  in  the\nlong  term  (risk  of  uterine  rupture  in  subsequent\npregnancies, risk of abnormal placentation in future\npregnancies)  should  be  weighed  carefully  against\npotential benefits to the mother and infant in making\nthe decision to proceed with Cesarean birth.\nIndications for Cesarean birth are the following:\n\u25cf  Maternal hemorrhage\n\u25cf  Fetal-pelvic\n\ndisproportion  with\n\nabnormal\n\nprogression of labor\n\n\u25cf  Uterine rupture\n\u25cf  Fetal  malpresentation  that  cannot  be  resolved\n\nwith rotation",

    "Perimortem  or  resuscitative  Cesarean  is  a\npotentially life-saving surgery in the event of cardiac\narrest  in  a  pregnant  individual.  It  is  indicated  in\npregnancies  that  are  20  weeks  or  more  advanced\n(uterus at the umbilicus) since the gravid uterus can\nimpede blood flow at this gestational age.  Previously\nineffective  resuscitative  efforts  may  be  effective\nonce  the  uterus  is  no  longer  gravid.  A  perimortem\nCesarean  needs  to  be  performed  quickly  after  4\nminutes  of  cardiac  arrest  with  unsuccessful\nresuscitation.  The  Cesarean  should  be  performed\nsimultaneously while cardiopulmonary resuscitation\nis being done.\n\nThe  following  describes  the  steps  for  a\nstandard Cesarean birth  and what to do when  more\ncomplicated scenarios present themselves.\n\nSteps:\n1.

If  delivery  with  this\napproach is not achieved, one of  the two following\nstrategies need to be chosen:\n\nPush method: An assistant uses a gloved hand\nto apply even pressure on the fetal head vaginally to\ndisengage the fetal head while the operating surgeon\nelevates the fetal head out of the pelvis for delivery\nonce it has been disengaged.",

When  the  fetal  head  is  deeply\nimpacted in the maternal pelvis, it creates a suction-\nlike  effect.  It  most  often  occurs  after  prolonged\nsecond  stage  of  labor  or  failed  operative  vaginal\ndelivery. If extreme force is used to try to deliver the\nbaby in these circumstances, this can lead to maternal\ntrauma  (damage  to  the  uterus,  cervix  or  vagina)  or\nsevere  injury  to  the  fetus  (skull  injury,  intracranial\nhemorrhage, or death.)",

This\nallows a second surgeon or experienced assistant to\nassist  in  applying  pressure  from  below  on  the  fetal\nhead to elevate the head if needed. If an assistant is\nnot  available,  the  surgeon  performing  the  Cesarean\ncan  attempt  to  disengage  the  fetal  head  manually\neither prior to starting the Cesarean or after an initial\ndelivery  attempt.

    "Closure of Laparotomy Wound Dehiscence\nRichard Davis\n\nIntroduction:\n\nDehiscence  of  a  laparotomy  wound  in  the\nearly  stages  of  healing  is  a  dreaded  complication.\nUsually it means a return to the operating room for\nclosure,  with  more  surgical  stress,  danger  of\ncomplications, and prolonged recovery.\n\nWound  dehiscence  can  be  caused  by\ntechnical factors (surgeon error) or by patient factors.\nTechnical  factors  include  failing  to  perform  the\nfascial closure adequately, or closing the fascia with\nthe  wrong  type  of  suture  that  absorbs  too  quickly\n(such as Polyglycolic acid, also known as Vicryl \u00ae.)\nAnother technical error is failure to consider patient\nfactors  such  as  those  below,  leading  to  failure  to\nreinforce the closure appropriately when doing it for\nthe first time.",
    "Patient factors are many and include obesity,\nintra-abdominal  infection,  emergency  surgery,  high\nabdominal  pressure  on  closing,  chronic  cough,\nchronic\nsteroid  use,  and  collagen  disorders\n(including those that predispose to abdominal aortic\naneurysm formation.) Greater than all of these, and\naccompanying  many  of  them,  is  malnutrition.  This\ncondition  accompanies  many  surgical  and  non-\nsurgical  diseases,\ncancer,  Human\nincluding\nImmunodeficiency  Virus  infection,  tuberculosis,\nachalasia,  Zenker\u2019s  diverticulum,  and  a  whole  host\nof  others.

    "Wound  dehiscence  can  present  subtly.\nSometimes  the  only  clue  is  discharge  of  a  large\namount of serous fluid from  the skin wound. If  the\nskin wound has watery fluid discharge, gently probe\nthe wound and feel the fascial closure underneath. If\nyou can feel a gap in the fascia, it is dehisced. This\nwill almost always be an indication to return to the\noperating room for closure, except in those situations\ndescribed below.\n\nIf you do not make the diagnosis at this stage,\nthe problem will most likely present itself in a more\ndramatic  fashion.  During  mobilization  or  a  cough,\nthe  wound  suddenly  bursts  open  and  the  intestines\nappear, sometimes protruding from the abdomen. In\nthis  case,  surgical  re-exploration  is  mandatory  and\nmust be done very soon.\n\nSometimes  fascial  dehiscence  accompanies\nan intra-abdominal infection, either an abscess or an",
    "Sometimes  fascial  dehiscence  accompanies\nan intra-abdominal infection, either an abscess or an\n\nanastomotic  leak.  Purulent  discharge  from  the  skin\nincision may be a superficial wound infection, but if\nthe amount of pus is very high, consider whether it is\ncoming from the abdominal cavity. Gently probe the\nwound  and  feel  for  a  defect  in  the  fascia.  If  one  is\npresent,  it  is  very  unlikely  that  the  patient  will\nrecover without another operation.

Otherwise perform bedside\nultrasound yourself and try to assess where the fluid\ncollections are. This patient will need an operation to\nwash  out  all  of  the  abdomen,  find  the  enterotomy,\nand either repair it with an omental patch or divert it\nthrough an ostomy.",

    "Conflict Management\nRobert Sinyard, Gady Barutwanayo, Richard Davis\n\nIntroduction:\n\nConflict  within  the  field  of  surgery  is\ninevitable.  Considering  the  complexity  of  systems\nissues,  the  high  stress  of  surgery,  and  imperfect\npeople, we should expect to encounter conflict on a\ndaily  basis.  In  fact,  some  conflict  should  be\nwelcomed  because  it  can  identify  opportunities  for\nimprovement,  to  achieve  better  care.  An  operating\ntheater or ward where people are afraid to speak up\nout  of  a  desire  to  \u201cavoid  conflict\u201d  is  a  dangerous\nplace  indeed. So the focus of  this chapter  is not on\nhow  to  avoid  conflict,  but  how  to  maximize  the\nproductive  type  of  conflict  and  minimize  the\npersonal and detrimental type.\n\nBenefits of Conflict:\n\nHealthy,  task-oriented  conflict  can  produce\n\nnumerous benefits:\n\nConflict Encourages New Thinking",
    "Benefits of Conflict:\n\nHealthy,  task-oriented  conflict  can  produce\n\nnumerous benefits:\n\nConflict Encourages New Thinking\n\nAlthough  it  is  often  assumed  that  people\navoid  conflict,  many  people  actually  enjoy  conflict\nto a certain degree because it can be the stimulus for\nnew thinking. Considering a different point of view,\nwhich sometimes comes with conflict, can open up\nnew possibilities and help to generate new ideas that\nmight otherwise have not been considered.\n\nConflict Raises Questions\n\nin\n\nOrganizational  conflict  usually  leads  to  a\nseries  of  questions  for  those  on  both  sides  of  any\nissues.  These  questions  can  lead  to  new  ideas  and\nthat  can  benefit\nthinking\nbreakthroughs\nindividuals,  departments,  and  organizations.  When\nthere  is  no  conflict,  nothing  changes.  There  is  no\nneed to question or challenge the status quo. Conflict\nrepresents  an  opportunity  to  reconsider,  which  can\nlead to breakthrough thinking.",
    "Conflict Builds Relationships\n\nBeing  agreeable  is  nice,  but  encouraging\nrelationships.\nconflict  can  actually  strengthen\nOrganizational\nindividuals,\nbetween\ndepartments and even competitors can help to build\nrelationships  through  mutual  understanding  and\nrespect. Learning to listen and listening to learn leads\n\nconflict\n\nto  insights  valued  by  both  sides  in  any  conflict\nsituation. Leaders who sincerely value  the opinions\nand  ideas  of  their  subordinates  are  not  only  more\neffective  leaders,  they  are  also  considered  more\nvaluable  by  their  employees.  If  an  employee  feels\nthat management values their opinion, that employee\nwill  value  the  work  more  and  overall  morale  will\nincrease.\n\nConflict Opens Minds",
    "Conflict Opens Minds\n\nOrganizations  that  teach  employees  how  to\nmanage  conflict  effectively  create  a  climate  of\ninnovation that encourages creative thinking. Minds\nare  opened\nto  new,  previously  unexplored\npossibilities. Considering new ways of approaching\nchallenges and meeting the demands of a competitive\nbusiness  world  can  result  in  improvements  that\nbenefit staff as well as the organization.\n\nConflicts Combats Stagnation\nOrganizations\n\nthat  avoid  conflict  avoid\nchange. Avoiding change is futile and can lead to the\ndemise of even successful organizations. Companies\nthat encourage staff to approach conflict in positive\nand  productive  ways  can  beat  the  stagnation  that\nopens  the  doors  to  competitors,  challenging  their\nability to provide customers with new and innovative\nsolutions.\n\nManaging Yourself",
    "Managing Yourself\n\nConsider  each  interaction  in  the  overall\ncontext. To \u201cwin\u201d the present \u201cbattle,\u201d while failing\nto achieve your long-term goal is an overall loss. The\nconflict that happens in the operating room should be\npart  of  the  daily  life  of  any  surgeon.  If  there  is  no\nconflict, you should ask yourself whether the theater\nstaff and you have the same vision for improvement.\nThis  is  not  to  say  that  you  should  trigger  conflict\nintentionally.  Rather,  when  conflict  happens,  it\nmeans  that  your  team  members  have  their  own\nsolutions  to  the  problems  you  face.  Value  their\nthoughts;  often,  the  worker  \u201con  the  ground  level\u201d\nknows  the  solution  to  the  problems  that  vex\nleadership. The way you handle the present conflict\nis the key to winning or losing your team members\u2019\ntrust.",

    "Psychological Safety exists when team members\nknow they can share ideas, thoughts, and\nquestions, or even admit mistakes, without being\npunished, humiliated, or having their reputation\ndamaged.\n\nYou, the surgeon, function as team leader in\nthe operating room. Your main goal is to  influence\nyour  team  members  by  creating  an  environment  of\ncomfort  where  everybody  feels  free  to  talk  even\nduring conflict. It is good for you to share with your\nteam  members  what  your  objectives  are  and  what\nworks well for you.\n\nSuccess requires clear communication. When\nleading a team, one of your primary responsibilities\nis making sure your team works well together. Often,\nindividuals with varying personalities comprise these\nteams.  The  ability  to  recognize  potential  conflicts\nbetween individual team members and resolve them\nquickly  is  essential  for  the  projects  to  proceed\nsuccessfully.",
    "Consider your own assumptions. Be willing\nto admit  that you might be wrong about something\nthat you think you know. As you may have noticed,\nthis can be difficult for surgeons, since we often have\nin-depth knowledge about a highly specialized topic.\nWe  may  have  a  hard  time  admitting  that  there  are\nthings we don\u2019t know. But there are many factors at\nplay  during  a  patient\u2019s  care,  most  of  which  are  not\nunder our direct control or even occurring with our\nknowledge. Worse, people \u201cunder\u201d us might have a\ndifferent, perhaps even better understanding of some\nof these factors.\n\nIn  a  rapidly  advancing  and  changing  world,\nthe advantage goes to the one who is willing to let go\nof  assumptions  when  the  evidence  shows  that  they\nare incorrect.

    "In  the  world  of  healthcare,  most  people  are\ntruly invested in providing great care to patients, but\nwe often assume the worst. The ladder of inference\nhelps  us  deconstruct  these  assumptions,  in  order  to\nconstruct  more  positive  ones.  When  you  know  you\nneed  to  engage  a  consultant,  a  nurse,  a  trainee,  or\neven a patient about something that has the potential\nto cause conflict, or already has caused it, try using\nthe  ladder  of  inference  via  the  following  two\nquestions:\n\n1. What are the facts of this situation?\n2. Why would a reasonable, rational, kind person\nbehave this way?\n\nTo illustrate, let\u2019s apply these two questions\n\nto an example closer to home:",
    "1. What are the facts of this situation?\n2.

While rounding in the morning you\nnotice that a lobectomy patient on postoperative day\n3 has a new 3 cm pneumothorax after his chest tube\nwas removed yesterday. The patient is asymptomatic\nbut  you  think  the  patient  probably  needs  another\nchest  tube.  After  rounds,  you  call  the  consultant\nsurgeon who asks that you not place a chest tube but\ninstead  carefully  watch  the  patient  during  the  day\nand  repeat  an  x-ray\nthe  afternoon.  You\ncommunicate  the  plans  for  all  the  patients  to  the\nother trainees under your supervision and head off\nto the operating room.\n\nin",

    "No doubt a conversation with your intern is\nwarranted. But as you feel the hairs on  the back of\nyour neck rising in anger, you realize that maybe the\nladder  of  inference  might  be  helpful  here.  Well,  at\nleast  you\u2019ll  give  it  a  try  before  you  go  have  a  very\ndifficult conversation with your intern. First, what do\nyou  actually  know?  The  intern  placed  a  chest  tube\nwithout your permission? The intern defied the plan\nfrom the consultant surgeon?",
    "Actually,  none  of  that.  Those  are  narratives\nlaced with inferences. All you know is that the nurse\nis reporting that a patient has a new chest tube. What\nif  you  did  a  little  more  fact  finding?  For  instance,\nsuppose  you  ask  the  nurse  which  patient  he  is\nreferring to and you find that there is a trauma patient\nwho  just  got  admitted  and  needed  a  chest  tube?\nSuppose  the  patient  actually  has  a  nasogastric  tube\nand the nurse just misspoke? Do you feel your anger\ncooling  off  already?  Much  more  fact  finding,  as\naddressed  in  Question  1,  is  necessary  in  this\nsituation.",
    "But, for the sake of the exercise, let\u2019s say that\nyou  go  into  the  room  and  indeed  see  the  patient  in\nquestion, sitting with a chest tube in. How could your\nintern do something so horrendous- change the plan\nand not even discuss it with you? How could she be\nso  insubordinate?  Feel  the  anger  rising  again?  See\nthose inferences sliding in again? Question 2 helps\nus  not  move  up  the  ladder  of  inference  so  quickly.\nAsk yourself, \u201cwhy would my intern, who I know is\nwell intentioned, reasonable, and rational place this\nchest tube?\u201d\n\nImmediately,  this  assumption  of  positive\nintent  leads  to  alternate  explanations.  For  instance,\nwhat  if  the  patient  started  decompensating  acutely\nand a tension pneumothorax was suspected? Or what\nif the consultant came in and rounded with the intern\nand he asked for the chest tube to be placed? Simply\nconsidering  these  possibilities  is  likely  enough  to\nbring the emotional barometer down to a reasonable",

With a better understanding of the facts and an\nassumption of positive intent, you\u2019re ready to contact\nyour intern and dig further.\n\nThe Advocacy-Inquiry Technique\n\nAs  a  surgeon,  you  must  be  aware  of  the\nimplicit hierarchy. You are at the \u201ctop.\u201d The people\nyou  interact  with  have  interacted  previously  with\nsurgeons; likely they have been reminded, in not-so-\nsubtle ways, about this hierarchy and their place in it,\nbelow  the  surgeon\u2019s.  But  the  best  way  to  resolve\nconflict, and to encourage effective communication,\nis  to  not  use  the  \u201ccommand  and  control\u201d  behavior\nthat  this  hierarchy  suggests.  The  Advocacy  and\nInquiry technique is based on two ideas\n1.  You  have  a  clear  understanding  of  what  is\nhappening  with  the  patient.  In  most  cases  of\nconflict, you have observed that the plan has not\nbeen followed somehow.",
    "2.  Since the plan has not been followed, the person\nyou\u2019re  addressing  must  be  aware  of  some\ninformation that you are not.\n\nYou  give  your  perspective,  usually  an\nobservation, then give the other person a  chance to\nexplain  the  reasons  for  your  observation.  In  effect,\nyou give them the benefit of the doubt and refuse to\nclimb  up  the  Ladder  of  Inference.

    "You  may  also  find  that  people  around  you,\noffended  by  your  assumptions,  begin  to  passively\nresist you and engage in small acts of \u201csabotage.\u201d\n\nHealthy Team Dynamics\n\nStudies of patient safety clearly show that the\npatient  is  safest  when  all  members  of  the  team  are\nempowered to speak if they have a concern.

    "Ad hoc / On the Spot conflict management\n\nDespite the utility of all the techniques above,\nthere are often situations which don\u2019t allow for any\nrehearsal. These acute moments of conflict are often\nthe  most  dangerous  because  we\u2019re  likely  to  let  our\nemotions  get  the  best  of  us.  Try  to  convert  acute\nconflicts to planned, emotionally calmer ones if at all\npossible.  For  instance,  in  a  heated  moment  with  a\nconsultant, you might consider asking if it would be\nokay  to  call  her  back  shortly  or,  in  the  operating\nroom, to speak in private after the case. This should\ngive  you  time  to  enact  some  of  the  techniques\ndescribed above. For those moments where this is not\npossible, here are a few brief thoughts:\n\nFirst, try to remain emotionally aware. If you\nsense  your  pulse  skyrocketing,  acknowledge  it.\nSome find that a few deep breaths through the nose\nhelps  slow  down  an  accelerating  sense  of  fury  or\noutrage.\n\ntry\n\nSecond,\n\nto  assume  positive",
    "try\n\nSecond,\n\nto  assume  positive\n\nintent.\nReminding yourself that the person on the other side\nof the conflict is a good person and wants good for\nthe patient- this approach can help you view her/him\ndifferently.  Similarly,  try  reminding  yourself  to  be\ncurious  about  why  someone  is  doing  something\nseemingly egregious, understanding that they intend\ngood for the patient.\n\nThird, humble yourself, no matter who is at\nfault,  and  ask  for  help.  This  approach  will  often\ndefuse any difficult situation. Virtually all who are in\nhealthcare went into the field in order to help others.\nFrequently we can appeal to this sense of service. For\ninstance,  imagine  you're  calling  a  consultant  in  the\nearly hours of the morning. Your opening statement\nmay  lead  to  conflict  or  prevent  it.  \u201cHi,  this  is  a\nconsult for\u2026\u201d as compared to \u201cSorry to bother you\nat  this  time,  but  we  need  help  with  a  difficult\nsituation and I think your expertise would be really\nuseful.\u201d",
    "Finally,  and  most  importantly,  prioritize  the\npatient. No matter the conflict among team members,\nproviders, or systems issues, choosing to do the right\nthing  for  the  patient  in  front  of  you  is  typically\nsomething  everyone  can  agree  on.  Finding  this\ncommon  ground  is  likely  the  best  place  to  start  for\nresolving any conflict.\n\nConclusion",
    "Conclusion\n\nIt\u2019s  worth  concluding  with  three  quick\nthoughts  regarding  growth  from  conflict  both\npersonally  and  interpersonally.  Great  leaders  use\ntheir  experiences  to  promote  growth.  It\u2019s  been  said\nthat we don\u2019t grow from our  experiences, we grow\nfrom reflecting on them. If you want to improve the\nway you manage conflict, try scheduling regular time\nto  review  your  past  week  and  consider  how  you\nperformed  during  times  of  duress,  particularly  as  it\nrelates  to  conflict.  How  well  did  you  manage  your\nemotions? Did you assume positive intent? Did you\nprioritize  the  patient?

Whilst\nthe  radical  mastectomy  and  modified  radical\nmastectomy\nlymph  node\ninclude  an  axillary\nis  usually\nthe  simple  mastectomy\ndissection,\nperformed  with  a  sentinel  node  biopsy  to  stage  the\naxilla and if the sentinel node is positive, the axilla is\nthen treated with a completion lymph node dissection\nor more recently with axillary radiotherapy to avoid\na  second  surgical  procedure.  Axillary  Dissection  is\ndiscussed in a separate chapter.",
    "The  radical  mastectomy  is  an  obsolete\noperation,  so  in  this  chapter  we  will  discuss  the\nompradical mastectomy or simple mastectomy. The\nmodified radical mastectomy is still very common in\nresource-limited  settings;  it  involves  a  combination\nof  mastectomy,  as  described  here,  and  axillary\ndissection, as described in its own chapter.",
    "The incisions for these two procedures are the\nsame  and  there  are  two  main  incisions  that  can  be\nused.  The  incisions  involve  removing  an  ellipse  of\nskin along with the breast  tissue, the nipple-areolar\ncomplex and the amount of skin removed depends on\nthe size of the breast. The aim of a good mastectomy\nis  to  remove  enough  skin  so  there  is  no  redundant\nskin on the chest wall at the end of the mastectomy,\nbut  at  the  same  time  not  removing  too  much  skin\nmaking  closure  of  the  wound  difficult.  One  should\nalso  make  sure  that  the  entire  extent  of  the  breast\ntissue is removed, as leaving behind any breast tissue\nwill increase the risk of local recurrence of the breast\ncancer.  The  steps  in  this  chapter  show  how  to\nproperly remove all the breast tissue.",

For an oblique ellipse, Point A\nis marked medially, a few centimeters below the\nlevel of the nipple and point B is placed close to\nthe axilla, on the lateral border of the pectoralis\nmajor or just lateral to it.",
    "Two incisions for simple mastectomy: the horizontal (Top) and\noblique (Bottom) ellipses. Both incisions allow generous access\nto remove all breast tissue in continuity with the nipple-areola\ncomplex. The ellipse should be large enough so that after the\nbreast tissue is removed, the skin edges can be closed without\neither redundancy or tension.\n\n1.  The  patient  is  positioned  in  the  supine  position\nwith the arm of the mastectomy side being placed\non  an  arm  board,  abducted  to  90  degrees.  The\nchest wall-arm junction should be at the edge of\nthe  table,  where  the  surgeon  will  stand.  The\nassistant stands on the same side as the surgeon\nand above the abducted arm.\n\n2.  The breast, axilla and the upper arm are prepared\nand  draped.  One  does  not  have  to  prepare  and\ndrape the upper arm in a way that the arm can be\nmobilized during surgery, though some surgeons\nmay prefer to do this.",
    "3.  The ellipse of the skin incision is marked on the\nbreast.  For  the  horizontal  ellipse  mastectomy,\ntwo points A and B are first marked on the breast\nwith a sterile marking pen. Point A is the medial\nextent of the ellipse and is placed at the level of\nthe nipple 1 to 2cms lateral to the midline. Point\nB  is  the  lateral  extent  of  the  ellipse,  and  the\nplacement of this point will differ depending on\nwhether one is planning a horizontal ellipse or an\noblique ellipse. Point B should not extend too far\nlaterally  and  should  not  extend  beyond  the\nmidaxillary line. The further lateral one extends\npoint B, the more likely one is to end up with a\n\u201cdog  ear\u201d  at  the  lateral  extent.

    "4.  For  both  the  horizontal  and  oblique  ellipse\nmastectomies, the breast is pulled down with one\nhand and the points A and B are connected by a\ngentle  convex  ellipse  which  marks  the  incision\nfor the superior flap.\n\nPull the nipple downwards gently and make a convex line that\nconnects the two points.\n\nOPEN MANUAL OF SURGERY IN RESOURCE-LIMITED SETTINGS\nwww.vumc.org/global-surgical-atlas\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License\n\n\fMastectomy\nDayalan Clarke",

For this the surgeon holds a\nmarking  pen  or  raised  index  finger  halfway\nbetween their eyeline and the breast.

    "Temporary Vascular Shunting\nMark Bowyer, Christopher Gross\n\nIntroduction\n\nTemporary  vascular  shunting  is  a  surgical\nprocedure  used  to  rapidly  restore  blood  flow  to  an\narea  of  the  body  when  there  is  an  injury  or\nobstruction  in  a  blood  vessel.  This  technique\ninvolves  inserting  a  temporary  conduit,  called  a\nshunt, into the blood vessel to bypass the damaged or\nblocked  segment.  The  shunt  maintains  perfusion  to\nthe  tissues  downstream  of  the  injury,  preventing\nischemia  (lack  of  blood  flow)  and  potential  tissue\ndamage.\n\nThis  procedure  is  often  used  in  emergency\nsettings, such as during trauma surgery, to stabilize\nthe  patient  and  buy  time  until  a  more  permanent\nvascular  repair  can  be  performed.

    "Management of Priapism\nGabrielle Yankelevich, Mary Prickett, Tara Sweeney, Kyler Perry\n\nIntroduction:\n\nPriapism,  an  erection  lasting  longer  than  4\nhours,  can  be  caused  by\ntrauma,  neurologic\nconditions, medications, hematologic conditions (e.g.\nsickle cell disease), or idiopathic. The two types are\nischemic  (low-flow,  occlusive)  and  non-ischemic\n(high-flow,  non-occlusive).  It\nto\nthese  presentations-  non-ischemic\ndifferentiate\npriapisms  are  typically  self-resolving,  but  ischemic\npriapisms  are  a  urologic  emergency.  Longer\nischemic  times  have  higher  rates  of  cavernosal\nfibrosis,  which\nto  permanent  erectile\ndysfunction.\n\nimportant\n\nleads\n\nis",
    "important\n\nleads\n\nis\n\nKnowing  penile  anatomy  is  important  for\nboth an anesthetic block and the priapism take-down\nprocedure. The urethra is found on the ventral aspect\nof the penis, so this should be carefully avoided. The\ncorpora are located dorsally and laterally. The dorsal\nveins,  artery,  and  nerves  are  found  on  the  dorsal\nmidline of the penis.\n\nCorpora  cavernosa,  right  and  left,  and  their  relation  to  the\nglans penis and corpus spongiosum (in this illustration called\ncorpus  cavernosum  urethrae).  Because  of  this  relationship,\ncreating an opening between the glans penis and the corpora\ncavernosa  allows  blood  to  drain  out  of  the  corpora  into  the\nglans and return to the body through the corpus spongiosum.",
    "Cross-section of the penile shaft. The two erectile bodies are\ntogether  called  the  corpora  cavernosa  (each  erectile  body\nindividually  is  called  a  corpus  cavernosum.)  The  corpora\ncavernosa  is  surrounded  by  the  tunica  albuginea,  a  thick\nfibrous  sheath.  The  urethra  is  surrounded  by  a  smaller\nstructure that also fills with blood, the corpus spongiosum (here\ncalled corpus cavernosum urethrae). All shunts described here\ncreate  a  connection  that  allows  each  corpus  cavernosum  to\ndrain into the corpus spongiosum.\n\nThe  majority  of  priapisms  can  be  resolved\nwith  corpus  cavernosum  aspiration  and  irrigation\n(+/-  phenylephrine).  Distal  percutaneous  or  open\nshunts  can  be  used  if  detumescence  cannot  be\nobtained with aspiration. Proximal shunts or venous\nanastomotic  shuts  are  very  rarely  utilized  due  to\nsuccess with distal shunts.",
    "All distal shunts, either open or percutaneous, have in common\nthe  creation  of  an  opening  between  the  distal  corpus\ncavernosum and the glans penis, as shown above, by piercing\nthe tunica albuginea that lies between them. This allows blood\nto exit the corpus cavernosum through the glans into the corpus\nspongiosum, in the direction shown by the arrows.\n\nIt is important to consider whether a priapism\nis  ischemic  or  non-ischemic,  as  the  acuity  and\napproach  change  between  the  two.  Blood  gas\nanalysis, if available, can be helpful in determining\nwhich  type  of  priapism  is  present.

All  of  these\ncomplications  inevitably  lead  to  increased  duration\nof hospitalization and increased cost of healthcare.\nFinally, there is a growing body of evidence\nthat suggests that poorly controlled surgical pain can\nlead to the development of chronic pain (pain at the\nsite of incision which continues for greater than three\nmonths). For all of these reasons and many more, we\nbelieve  that  recognizing,  assessing  and  treating\nperioperative  pain  is  of  great  importance  in  the\nsurgical care of patients in any setting.\n\nPathophysiology",
    "Pathophysiology\n\nThe  International  Association  for  the  Study\nof  Pain  defines  pain  as  \u201can  unpleasant  sensory  and\nemotional  experience  associated  with  actual  or\npotential tissue damage, or described in terms of such\nseveral\ndamage.\u201d  This  definition  highlights\nimportant  points.  First,  the  pain  pathways  are\nintricately linked to the cortical emotional centers of\nthe  brain.  Pain  can  contribute  to  anxiety  and\ndepression which can, in turn, worsen pain. Second,\ntissue  damage  does  not  need  to  be  obvious  for  a\npatient to be suffering from pain. Pain is a subjective\nexperience, and it is never the job of the healthcare\nprovider (surgeon, nurse, anesthetist) to assume that\na patient is or is not in pain.\n\nIntroduction",
    "Introduction\n\nThe  World  Health  Organization  estimates\nthat  5.5  billion  people  do  not  have  access  to\ntreatments for moderate to severe pain. The majority\nof  these  people  live  in  low-  and  middle-income\ncountries.  As  the  availability  of  surgical  services\nincreases in these settings, the need for treatments for\nmoderate  to  severe  perioperative  pain  will  also\nincrease.  The  barriers  to  improving  access  to\ntreatment  for  pain  are  numerous  and  include  low\nprioritization of pain relief by both the patient and the\nhealthcare provider, lack of understanding regarding\ntherapies,  misconceptions  about  opioid  addiction,\nlack of reliable supply chains for analgesics, and lack\nof  understanding  regarding  the  physical,  social  and\nemotional harms of poorly controlled pain.",
    "Despite  these  obstacles,  it  has  been  shown\nthat improvements in pain management are possible,\neven  in  low-resource  settings.  In  recent  years  there\nhas  been  growth  in  both  research  and  advocacy\nrelated  to  pain  management  in  austere  settings.\nHowever,  without  access  to  pain  management\neducation these efforts will be wasted. Essential Pain\nManagement (EPM) is one example of a step toward\nimproving access to education in pain management.\nEPM was developed in 2010 as a short course (one\nto two days) to be delivered to healthcare providers\nof different cadres to equip these providers with the\nnecessary  tools  to  recognize,  assess  and  treat  pain,\nespecially in low-resource settings.

Pain\nbegins  with  the  activation  of  nociceptors  by  a\nnoxious  stimulus  (e.g.,  a  surgical  incision).  This\ntriggers the transmission of pain impulses through A\ndelta and C sensory nerve fibers to the dorsal horn of\nthe spinal cord, the first relay center. These impulses\nare then relayed to the opposite side of the spinal cord\nand travel cephalad to the thalamus, the second relay\ncenter. From the thalamus, signals are transmitted to\nnumerous  areas  of  the  brain  (including  the  limbic\nsystem)  where  the  \u201cperception  of  pain\u201d  occurs.  At\nthe  same  time,  descending  pathways  modulate\nongoing pain signals as a negative feedback loop.",
    "One point which is often ignored  is the fact\nthat  nociception  and  perception  of  pain  are  not\nidentical.

The most useful\nand  widely  used  tool  for  guiding  treatment  of\nperioperative pain is the World Health Organization\nAnalgesic Ladder (Above) According to this ladder\nmost patients with mild pain (pain score of 3 or less)\ncan have their pain adequately controlled with simple\nanalgesics  (e.g.,  paracetamol  and/or  non-steroidal\nanti-inflammatories.)  A  patient  with  moderate  pain\n(pain  score  of  4-6)  will  likely  need  a  mild  opioid\n(e.g.,  codeine  or  tramadol)  in  addition  to  simple\nanalgesics.

It  is  widely  available  in\nboth  high  and  low-resource  settings.  However,  in\nmany hospitals it is rarely used. There is a great deal\nof fear surrounding the use of morphine, especially\nwith regards to its risk of addiction and side effects.\nRegarding  addiction,  there  is  more  than  sufficient\nevidence available that giving morphine to a patient\nin pain does not lead to addiction. Addiction occurs\nwhen  patients  take  morphine  for  purposes  that  it  is\nnot indicated for, either to manage pain chronically\nor for recreational use. For patients with acute severe\npain, however, morphine is most certainly indicated\nand  it  can  be  given  safely  if  one  is  aware  of  the\nappropriate dosing and understands how to monitor\nfor side effects.",
    "For most patients with severe pain, a starting\ndose  of  intravenous  morphine  between  0.05  mg/kg\nand  0.2  mg/kg  is  appropriate,  depending  on  their\nlevel of pain. This dose should be given every 3 to 4\nhours for patients who continue to be in severe pain.\nIf patients can take oral medications, oral morphine\n(syrup  or  tabs)  may  be  more  appropriate  and  has\ncertain  advantages,  including  slower  onset  and\noffset, lower cost, and the elimination of the need for\nan  intravenous  line  to  administer.  The  dose  of  oral\nmorphine needs to be doubled or tripled compared to\nintravenous  dosing  due  to  its  first-pass  hepatic\nmetabolism which rapidly reduces the active amount\nin the bloodstream. For example, a patient requiring\n5  mg  of  intravenous  morphine  every  4  hours,  may\nneed 15 mg of oral morphine every 4 hours.",
    "We  discourage  the  use  of  intramuscular\nmorphine for a variety of reasons. Although there is\na  popular  idea  that  the  effect  will  last  longer  if  the\nmedication is given intramuscular, this is not true. In\naddition,  the  absorption  of  intramuscular  injections\nis  variable  with  some  patients  receiving  much  less\nthan the total amount absorbed into the bloodstream.\nFinally,  intramuscular  injections  are  painful  for  the\npatient.  Therefore,  our  preference  would  be  to\nadminister oral morphine if possible. For patient who\ncannot  tolerate  orals,  intravenous  morphine  should\nbe  given.

For  most  adult  patients  a  dose  of  0.15  mg\nintrathecally  will  provide  potent\nadministered\nrespiratory\nrisk  of\nanalgesia  with  minimal\ndepression.  Doses  of  0.15  to  0.3  mg  are  associated\nwith  a  slightly  higher  risk  of  this  complication,\nwhereas a dose greater than 0.3 mg poses a high risk\nof respiratory depression and should be avoided.\n\nMorphine  in  any  form  should  be  used  with\n\ncaution in certain patients. Those patients include:\n\u25cf  Infants less than 6 months old\n\u25cf  Patients with renal failure\n\u25cf  Elderly patients\n\u25cf  Patients who are hemodynamically unstable\n\u25cf  Patients  with  known  or  suspected  obstructive\n\nsleep apnea",

In\nrare cases, an intestinal tumor serves as a lead point,\nwith incidence increasing with patient age.\n\nClinical presentation\n\nIntussusception  primarily  affects  children\nbetween  3  months  and  3  years  of  age,  with  peak\nincidence occurring between 5 and 9 months.\n\nThe  typical  presentation  includes  sudden\nonset of intermittent, crampy abdominal pain, often\naccompanied  by  leg  flexion  toward  the  chest  and\nepisodes  of  vomiting  that  last  for  a  few  minutes.\nThese  symptoms  alternate  with  periods  where  the\nchild appears normal.",

    "Airway Management in Trauma\nGregory Sund, Matthew Kynes, Phil Yao\n\nIntroduction:\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: This chapter builds on Airway\nManagement  and  Endotracheal  Intubation,  which\ndiscusses the basics of  airway management, specific\nequipment, medications, and management of difficult\nsituations. The reader will be well served by starting\nwith that chapter before reading this one.\n\nAirway management for trauma victims can\nbe challenging for a variety of reasons. These include\ndistortion of airway anatomy, obscured visualization\nfrom blood, emesis or other material, and the need to\nmaintain  the  head  in  a  neutral  position  when  a\ncervical spine injury is suspected. It is important to\nunderstand  the  particularities  of  each  situation  and\nhow to evaluate and to safely manage the airway in\nsuch patients.",
    "Before the airway can be managed, it must be\nassessed.  The  steps  in  the  evaluation  of  airway\npatency  and  adequacy  of  breathing  will  not  be\ndiscussed  in  this  chapter.  The  reader  instead  is\nreferred to Basic Life Support (BLS) and Advanced\nCardiac Life Support (ACLS) for further explanation\nof these steps. But it is important to understand that\nhypoxia and hypoventilation need to be recognized\nand acted upon quickly, as these can be signs of life-\nthreatening  injuries  and  can  worsen  the  level  of\nconsciousness  and  brain  injury  in  head-injured\npatients.  Some  of  the  particularities  of  airway\nmanagement in trauma victims are discussed below.\n\nCervical spine injury",
    "Cervical spine injury\n\nMost trauma patients are assumed to have a\ncervical  spine  injury  until  it  is  ruled  out  either  by\nphysical exam or imaging. Until such an injury has\nbeen  ruled  out  the  patient\u2019s  neck  must  remain  in  a\nneutral position at all times using a properly placed\ncervical  collar  or  manual  in-line  stabilization.  This\ncan  make\nintubation  difficult  or  sometimes\nimpossible. Therefore, it is important to be prepared\nwith  back-up  airway  equipment  (e.g.,  bougie,\nvideolaryngoscope,  cricothyroidotomy  kit)  before\nattempting intubation. If intubation fails the operator\nshould  also  be  prepared  to  insert  a  rescue  airway\ndevice  such  as  a  laryngeal  mask  airway.  The\nKing\nesophageal-tracheal\n\nCombitube\n\nor",
    "Combitube\n\nor\n\nsupralaryngeal  device  may  be  available  at  some\nhospitals  and  can  be  lifesaving  in  these  situations.\nWhile  these  devices  are  not  a  permanent  solution,\nthey can provide oxygenation and ventilation until a\nmore permanent airway can be established.\n\nProper  technique  for  cervical  spine  stabilization  during\nintubation when cervical spine injury has not been ruled out.\nThe  assistant  (left  side  of  the  picture)  uses  the  \u201cearmuff\u201d\ntechnique,  which  allows  the  mandible  to  move  downwards.\nDuring insertion of the tube, the assistant and the intubator will\nbe working \u201cagainst\u201d each other, as one tries to see the vocal\ncords as well as possible and the other tries to limit movement\nof the neck.

    "Risk of pulmonary aspiration\n\nAll  trauma  patients  are  considered  \u201cfull\nstomach\u201d and therefore at increased risk of aspiration\nof gastric contents. This is one reason why securing\nthe airway is so critical whenever the patient\u2019s level\nof consciousness is depressed (Glasgow Coma Scale\n[GCS] less than 8). Intubation should be performed\nwith rapid sequence induction in order to secure the\nairway as quickly as possible and protect the lungs\nfrom aspiration of gastric contents. This technique is\noutlined in the chapter on endotracheal intubation.\n\nIn our institution, we use cricoid pressure in\nall  rapid  sequence\ninductions.  In  theory,  this\nmaneuver  serves  to  occlude  the  esophagus  and\nprevent  aspiration  of  gastric  contents.  However,\nstudies  have  questioned  whether  cricoid  pressure\nactually achieves this effect. If used, this technique",

Excessive  cricoid\npressure  can  cause  further  trauma  to  the  airways.\nCricoid  pressure  can  also  obscure  the  view  of  the\nvocal cords, so ask the assistant to apply less pressure\nif you are having difficulty.\n\nInhalational burns\n\nsuspected\n\ninhalational",
    "Inhalational burns\n\nsuspected\n\ninhalational\n\nExposure  to  fire  and  smoke  in  an  enclosed\nspace  can  cause  inhalational  injury  to  the  airway\nresulting in progressive edema and airway closure. In\npatients  with\ninjury,\nendotracheal  intubation  should  be  performed  early\nbefore significant airway edema occurs. Inhalational\ninjury  should  be  suspected  in  any  patient  who  was\nexposed  to  a  fire  in  an  enclosed  space,  those  with\nsinged or soot-covered nostrils or mouth, and those\ndisplaying  signs  such  as  hoarseness,  dyspnea,\ntachypnea  or  altered  level  of  consciousness  not\nexplained by head injury. While succinylcholine can\nbe  used  safely  in  patients  within  48  hours  of  burn\ninjury,  those  outside  of  this  time  window  are  at\nincreased  risk  of  hyperkalemia  when  given  this\nmedication.  In  these  situations,  it  is  better  to  use  a\nnon-depolarizing muscle relaxant.",
    "Patients  with  severe  burn  injuries  or  those\nwhich  occurred  in  enclosed  spaces  should  also  be\nconsidered  at  risk  for  carbon  monoxide  poisoning.\nCarbon  monoxide  binds  to  hemoglobin  with  an\naffinity  approximately  250  times  that  of  oxygen.\nThis  results  in  a  left-ward  shift  of  the  oxy-\nhemoglobin  dissociation  curve  and\nimpaired\navailability  of  oxygen  at  the  level  of  the  tissues.\nBecause standard pulse oximetry cannot distinguish\nbetween  oxyhemoglobin  and  carboxyhemoglobin,\nthis  tool  will  display  a  falsely  elevated  oxygen\nsaturation  in  a  patient  with  carbon  monoxide\npoisoning.  In  patients  with  carboxyhemoglobin\nlevels  of  20%  or  greater  (measured  by  arterial  or\nvenous  blood  gas  analysis)\nintubation  and\nmechanical ventilation will be necessary to improve\noxygenation  and  enhance  carbon  dioxide  clearance\nby the body.",

However,  fractures  of  the  facial\nskeleton  rarely  exist  without  facial  lacerations  of\nsome kind. These are addressed in a separate chapter;\nrealistically you will be addressing both at the same\ntime.\n\nPatients with both mandibular and maxillary\nfractures  are  especially  challenging-  it  can  be\ndifficult to restore dental occlusion, and the danger\nof palate fistula or other complications is higher. As\nyou  begin  to  care  for  patients  with  facial  fractures,\napproach these \u201ccombined\u201d fractures very carefully;\nrefer them if you can until you have some experience\nwith each type individually.",
    "Remember that there is a frequent association\nbetween  facial  trauma,  cervical  spinal  trauma,  and\nhead  injury.  It  is  common  practice  to  empirically\nimmobilize the patient\u2019s cervical spine with a soft but\nrigid  collar  (\u201cPhiladelphia\u201d)  until  cervical  spine\ninjury has been ruled out.\n\nHere,  we  discuss  the  relevant  anatomy  and\ndiagnostic maneuvers to classify a midface fracture.\nEach separate operation is then considered in its own\nchapter.\n\nAnatomy:\n\nThe skin and nerves, lips, salivary glands and\nducts  are  considered  in  the  chapter  on  facial\nlacerations  and  injuries.  Lacerations  of  the  eyelids\nare considered in  their own chapter.  The globe and\norbit  are  so  inter-related  that  they  will  both  be\nconsidered here.\n\nWhen evaluating patients with facial injuries,\nit is crucial to understand the anatomy of the maxilla,\nzygoma,  naso-orbito-ethmoid  complex  and\nthe\njunction of these with the frontal bones.",
    "When evaluating patients with facial injuries,\nit is crucial to understand the anatomy of the maxilla,\nzygoma,  naso-orbito-ethmoid  complex  and\nthe\njunction of these with the frontal bones.\n\nThe midface can be conceptually pictured as\na  series  of  pillars,  providing  support  and  resisting\ninjury,  with  very  thin-walled  spaces  in  between,\nfilled with air or vital structures.\n\nThe  largest  air-filled  space  is  the  maxillary\nsinus.  Its  anterior  and  superior  walls  are  paper-thin\nproviding  little  structural  support.  The  anterior\naspects of its medial  and lateral walls, on the other\nhand,  are  quite  thick  and  serve  to  connect  the  hard\npalate and the upper teeth to the rest of the midface.",

Their  anterior  walls  (including  the  foramena  of  the\ninfraorbital nerves) and inferior walls (the orbital floors) are\nmade of very thin bone which provides little structural support.\nThe  thickened  portions  of  the  zygoma  (surrounded  by  dotted\nlines) are very thick: fractures rarely pass through these areas.\n\nKeeping  the  maxillary  sinuses  in  mind,  we\ncan think of a series of \u201cpillars\u201d in the intact midface\nwhere  the  structural  support  is  strongest.  Fractures\ncommonly  pass  through  these  areas.  They  are  also\ncalled \u201cbuttresses,\u201d after the support structures of a\nbuilding.

Be prepared for a difficult\nairway,  especially  if  the  trauma  occurred  several\nhours previously.

    "Endoscopic Placement of Ureteral Stents\nGeorge E. Koch, Niels V.

Stents can also be placed for partial ureteral\ninjuries,  especially  when\nthey  are  recognized\nendoscopically or in a delayed fashion.\n\nStents are available in different sizes and can\nbe tailored to the measured length of the ureter, based\non CT or plain pyelography.

    "Operative Vaginal Delivery\nLindsey E. Zamora\n\nIntroduction:\n\nOperative  vaginal  delivery\n\nis  when  an\nobstetrician  or  other  trained  birth  attendant  uses  a\ndevice to assist in the delivery in the second stage of\nlabor.  This can be done for either maternal or fetal\nindications  using  either  forceps  or  a  vacuum\nextractor.    The  use  of  either  of  these  tools  requires\nthat the obstetric care provider be familiar with both\nproper  use  and  the  risks  involved.    To  minimize\nharm,  operative  vaginal  delivery  should  be\nperformed only by an experienced operator.\n\nOperative\n\nvaginal\n\ndelivery  may\n\nbe\n\nrecommended  for the following indications:\n\u25cf  Prolonged second stage of labor\n\u25cf  Arrest of descent\n\u25cf  Suspicion of fetal compromise\n\u25cf  Maternal exhaustion and inability to push\n\u25cf  Maternal  medical  indications  and  need  to\n(e.g.  maternal  cardiac\n\navoid  Valsalva\ndisease)",

Also, it can often\nachieve a faster delivery than a Cesarean.\n\nStandard forceps used for either an outlet or\nlow  forceps  delivery  (see  Box  1)  have  the  parts\nshown  below:  the  handles,  lock,  shanks,  cephalic\ncurve which cups the fetal head, and the pelvic curve\nwhich  navigates  the  curve  of  the  maternal  pelvis\nduring delivery.",

In general,\nthe lower the fetal head and the less rotation required,\nthe  less  risk  to  the  mom  and  the  fetus.    For  the\npurposes of this document we will discuss outlet and\nlow  operative  vaginal  deliveries  (see  Box  1).

However, the early equipment\noffered less than optimal exposure due to tenting, and\nthe  design  was  clunky.  Hence  most  of\nthe\npublications  were  from  single  centre  experiences,\nalthough these indicated a potential usefulness of the\nmodality.  The  Gas  Insufflation-Less  Laparoscopic\nSurgeries (GILLS) was adopted by rural surgeons in\nlow-resource  settings  primarily  because  of  the\nfollowing advantages:\n\n1.

    "Accessing  the  retroperitoneal  space  with  a\nperitoneum-sparing  incision  through\nthe  lateral\nabdominal  wall  muscles  can  make  exposure  much\neasier  than  a  trans-  peritoneal  approach.  The  intra-\nabdominal contents are held back by the peritoneum\nitself,  so  retraction  is  much  simpler.  This  is  the\napproach  of  choice  for  open  access  to  mid-ureteric\nstones, psoas abscesses, the iliac vessels or even (in\nexperienced  hands)  the  infrarenal  aorta.  Another\nwell-described  use  of  this  approach  is  an  incision\nabove  the  inguinal  ligament,  accessing  the  external\niliac artery without entering the abdominal cavity, to\ngain proximal control of a femoral artery injury in the\ngroin.  This\nis  also  used  for  kidney\ntransplant;    the  kidney  is  placed  in  the  lateral\nretroperitoneal  /  retropelvic  space  after  the  renal\nvessels are anastomosed to the iliac artery and vein,\nand  the  ureter  is  implanted  into  the  bladder.

This\nplane can often be developed even in the presence of\ninflammation; the peritoneum is surprisingly tough.\nThe key to this approach is to keep in mind the layers\nof  the  lateral  abdominal  wall  and  to  be  aware  of\nwhich one is being divided or retracted.",

    "Approach to Abdominal Incisions\nRichard Davis\n\nBackground:\n\nThe choice and performance of an abdominal\nincision  will  strongly  affect  how  easy,  or  difficult,\nthe  operation  is.  The  experienced  surgeon,  the  one\nwho seems to make everything look easy, is a master\nat selecting the right type of incision.\n\nOne important factor in any  incision  is how\nwell it adapts to a change in plans. In this regard, the\nmidline incision through the linea alba is the best one\nto use in an unknown situation. It affords access to\nall of the abdominal cavity, and it can be extended as\nmuch as necessary.\n\nAnatomy:\n\nThe  lateral  abdominal  wall  is  made  up  of\nthree layers of muscles. As shown below, each layer\nhas its own orientation. This fact allows each layer to\nbe  identified,  allowing  safer  and  more  purposeful\nopening and closing during transverse, subcostal and\nretroperitoneal incisions.",

    "Principles:\n\nUnless dealing with an emergency situation,\none should always assure hemostasis while making\nan abdominal incision. Cut vessels in the abdominal\nwall  and  preperitoneal  space  can  continue  to  bleed\nduring an entire surgery, leading to an increased total\nblood loss that is entirely avoidable with a little extra\ncare.  This  is  especially  true  with  transverse  or\nsubcostal incisions that divide the rectus muscles; the\nepigastric  vessels  or  their  tributaries  can  retract\n\nLateral abdominal wall, deep layer. The transversus abdominis\nmuscle  runs  transversely  in  a  horizontal  orientation.  The\nextraperitoneal space, not the peritoneum, lies directly beneath\nit. With care, one can transect this muscle without entering the\nperitoneum and then develop the plane laterally to enter into\nthe retroperitoneum, as discussed in the chapter \u201cAnterolateral\nRetroperitoneal Incision.\u201d",
    "The linea alba is the name of the fascial space\nin between the two rectus muscles. This structure is\nsplit  and  then  reapproximated  during  a  midline\nlaparotomy. Fibers of both the anterior and posterior\nrectus sheath contribute to the linea alba for the upper\n2/3  of  its  length.  At  a  point  2-3  cm  below  the\numbilicus, the posterior rectus sheath ceases to be a\nfascial layer and can not be relied on to hold suture.\nThe  point  where  this  junction  occurs  is  called  the\nlinea  semicircularis.

These  include  the  face  and  scalp  and\nacross joints.\n\nThe  main  limitation  of  full  thickness  skin\ngrafts  is  the  size:  skin  must  be  taken  from  places\nwhere  it  is  \u201credundant.\u201d  When  you  remove  full\nthickness skin you must leave enough behind to still\nclose  the  wound.  Areas  where  this  can  be  done\ninclude  the  lower  neck,  the  groin,  the  posterior\naxillary fold, and  the abdomen.  For small grafts on\nthe  head  or  face,  the  skin  behind  the  ear  is  color-\nmatched and hairless.",
    "Full thickness skin grafts contract much less\nthan split thickness grafts do, so they are commonly\nused in sensitive areas of the face. For example, in a\nlarge facial burn it would be appropriate to use split\nthickness skin (not meshed) on most of the face, but\nthe  eyelids  would  be  better  treated  with  a  full\nthickness graft.\n\nFull  thickness  grafts  can  be  used  for  burn\ncontracture  reconstruction,  though  they  are  more\nlikely than flaps to cause recurrent contracture with\nthis application. Many practitioners will splint a joint\nfor a period of 3-6 months after contracture release\nand full thickness graft reconstruction.",
    "In  head  and  neck  reconstruction,  skin  for\ngrafting is often chosen from  the neck because this\narea has had the same sun exposure as the head, so\nthe color match of the graft will be better. This is less\nof an issue in people with very dark skin, however.\nOne other consideration is whether the donor\nsite bears hair, and whether hair is appropriate at the\nrecipient  site.  Most  people  would  not  want  hair\ngrowing on their forehead, or on the inside of their\nmouth.  And  if  hair-bearing  skin  is  used  as  a  for\nurethral reconstruction, either as a flap or a graft, the\nhair follicles can act as a nidus for stone formation.\nClosure of defects after head and neck tumor\nexcision is a complex subject. In some cases, a flap\nwill be better suited than a graft, especially in a hair-\nbearing part of the scalp.

    "Pfannenstiel Incision\nMarianna Frazee, Richard Davis\n\nIntroduction:\n\nThe  Pfannenstiel  Incision  derives  its  name\nfrom Hermann Johannes Pfannenstiel (1862\u20131909),\nthe German gynecologist who invented the technique\nin 1900. In the UK, the incision was popularized by\nMonroe Kerr, who first used it in 1911, so in English-\nspeaking  countries  it  is  sometimes  called  the  Kerr\nincision  or  the  Pfannenstiel\u2013Kerr  incision.  Today,\nthe Pfannenstiel incision is the most used incision for\nCaesarian Birth as well as urologic, orthopedic, and\npelvic  procedures.  For  urologic  procedures  such  as\nSuprapubic  Prostatectomy  or  in  some  instances  of\nUreter  Replantation,  the  incision  is  placed  low\nenough  to  allow  the  surgeon  to  remain  outside  the\nperitoneum, in the prevesical (extraperitoneal) space,\nas described further below.",
    "The  major  drawback  of  this  incision  is  its\nlimited  exposure  beyond  the  pelvis:  if  a  patient\u2019s\nintra-abdominal  pathology  is  unknown,  a  vertical\nmidline incision is more appropriate.\n\nBlood supply in the area includes the inferior\nepigastric  vessels,  which  lie  posterior  to  the  rectus\nmuscles, moving more laterally towards the external\niliac  vessels  as  they  proceed  into  the  pelvis.  The\nsuperficial epigastric vessels are found just below the\nskin-  when  the  incision  is  very  wide,  they  must  be\ndealt  with  during  the  skin  incision  to  prevent\ntroublesome bleeding.\n\nThe  Pfannenstiel\n\nis  reportedly\nassociated  with  a\nincidence  of  wound\ncomplications,  including  surgical  site  infection  and\nincisional hernia, than midline incisions.\n\nincision\n\nlower\n\nIn general, the steps of a Pfannenstiel incision",

The decision to make a Pfannenstiel incision can\nbe  surgeon  preference,  however  a  variety  of\noperations such as caesarian sections have made\n\nincision\n\nthe  standard  for\n\nPfannenstiel\nthat\nprocedure.

The patient lies in Supine Position, prepared and\ndraped  from  above  the  umbilicus  to  below  the\nperineum.  For  Cesarean  Section  a  right-handed\nsurgeon  stands  on  the  patient\u2019s  right  side.  For\nprostatectomy  a  right-handed  surgeon  generally\nstands on the patient\u2019s left.\n\n4.

Medially,  there  will  be\nonly  one  layer,  the  anterior  rectus  sheath  itself.\nLaterally, if the incision is wide enough (in most\ncases for Cesarean Section) it will extend into the\nthree layers of the lateral abdominal wall.\n\nOPEN MANUAL OF SURGERY IN RESOURCE-LIMITED SETTINGS\nwww.vumc.org/global-surgical-atlas\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License\n\n\fPfannenstiel Incision\nMarianna Frazee, Richard Davis\n\nThe  anterior  rectus  sheath  is  displayed  and  then  divided  to\nexpose the bilateral rectus muscles. It is important to clear all\nof the subcutaneous fat off of the anterior rectus sheath at this\ntime, to make it easier to identify during closure.",
    "Here,  Allis clamps are attached to the anterior rectus sheath\nabove both rectus muscles. These are retracted anteriorly by\nthe surgeon on the patient\u2019s left. The surgeon on the patient\u2019s\nright  bluntly  dissects  the  rectus  sheath  off  the  muscles  in  a\nsuperior direction. Next, divide the fascia at the midline.\n\nIf wide exposure is required, such as in a Cesarean Section, the\nincision will go beyond the anterior rectus sheath and into the\naponeuroses of the lateral abdominal wall muscles. This will be\nimportant to remember when closing the wound, as described\nbelow.",
    "6.  The  fascia  is  then  separated  from  the  rectus\nmuscles both superiorly and inferiorly by making\nflaps  using  both  blunt  finger  dissection  and\ndiathermy.  Occasionally  there  will  be  bleeding\nfrom  the  anterior  surface  of  the  rectus  muscle\nduring\nthis  can  be\ncontrolled  with  diathermy  or  application  of  a\nsmall clamp. The midline, the linea alba, requires\ndivision with the diathermy or a scalpel blade.\n\nthis  blunt  dissection;\n\nThis  maneuver  is  repeated  inferiorly,  with  the  retraction\nperformed  by  the  surgeon  on  the  patient\u2019s  right  and  the\ndissection by the surgeon on the patient\u2019s left. Here, the fascia\nhas been divided at the midline (Black arrow) allowing all of\nthe anterior sheath to be retracted away from the muscles.",
    "7.  Separate  the  right  and  left  rectus  muscles  from\neach other in the midline, taking care to not enter\nthe peritoneum at this step. If you dissect in the\ntrue midline between the muscles, you should not\nhave to divide any muscle fibers at all during this\nstep.  For  certain  procedures,  entering\nthe\nperitoneum will be the following step. For others,\nsuch as many urologic procedures, the goal is to\nremain in the preperitoneal space.\n\nOPEN MANUAL OF SURGERY IN RESOURCE-LIMITED SETTINGS\nwww.vumc.org/global-surgical-atlas\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License\n\n\fPfannenstiel Incision\nMarianna Frazee, Richard Davis",

This\nmaneuver  risks  causing  a  nerve  injury  to  the\nilioinguinal  nerve,  which  passes  between  the\nexternal and internal oblique layers. This can lead\nto chronic pain.\n\nThe  surgeon  and  assistant  pull  the  rectus  muscles  laterally,\nexposing and dividing the fascial tissue that joins them at the\nmidline. Try to find the midline and avoid dividing muscle at\nthis point.",
    "Once the muscles are free from each other at the midline, they\ncan be gently pulled apart. This reveals the transversalis fascia,\nwith the peritoneum posterior to this in the upper part of the\nincision. If you intend to enter the peritoneum, do so now. If you\ndo not, gently sweep the peritoneum upwards with a gauze; this\nmaneuver allows you to bluntly enter the prepelvic space.\n\n8.  Perform  the  operation  in  question,  using  a  self-\nretaining retractor such as the Balfour abdominal\nretractor to hold the rectus muscles laterally. For\nCesarean  Section,\nretractor  with  a\nthis\nremoveable  bladder  blade  is  very  commonly\nused.\n\n9.

It  is  understood  that  in  most  resource-\nlimited  settings,  pre-hospital  care,  and  even  pre-\nhospital  coordination  and  allocation  of  patients,  is\nnon-existent.  Patients  often  arrive  at  your  facility\nwith little or no warning, in excess of what you can\nsafely handle, with no option to transfer elsewhere.\nWhile  there  is no consensus definition for a\n\u201cmass  casualty,\u201d  we  will  adopt  the  World  Health\nOrganization definition: A mass casualty incident is\nan  event  which  generates  more  patients  at  one\ntime than locally available resources can manage\nusing routine procedures.

Surgery is by its nature a complex process,\nprone to unexpected outcomes no matter how careful\nyou  are,  or  how  perfectly  executed  your  treatment\nplan was. And yet, complications take a human toll.\nThis  is  true  for  the  patient,  of  course:  they  suffer\nlonger  recovery,  and  possibly\nmore  pain,  a\npermanent disability or death. But the human toll of\na  complication  also  falls  on  you,  the  surgeon.  You\nwatch  another  human  being  and  their  family  suffer\nbecause  of  something  you  were  involved  in.  It  is\nnatural for you to feel guilt, shame and fear. This is\nthe  Second  Victim  Syndrome:  psychological  and\nemotional trauma experienced by a medical provider\ndue to an adverse patient event.",
    "One  of  our  goals  is  to  help  you  walk  your\npatient and their loved ones through a complication.\nBut  before  you  can  do  that  well,  you  must  walk\nyourself through the process. You must deal with all\nthe \u201cbaggage\u201d that comes with a complication. In the\nprocess  of  recognizing  and  dealing  with  a\ncomplication, the best possible outcome is for you\nto remain a healthy human being and to become\na better surgeon.\n\nEvery experience, no matter how painful, has\na lesson that will help both your future patients and\nyou.  It  is  all  too  easy  to  hide  from  that  lesson  by\nignoring it, blaming others, distracting yourself with\nwork,  or  covering  up  your  feelings  with  drugs  or\nalcohol. It takes great courage to face the facts of the\ncomplication and learn from it. But if you refuse to\ndo  this,  you  do  a  disservice  to  yourself,  the  patient\ninvolved, and to your future patients.",

If\na  hollow  viscus  herniates  through  a  defect  in  the\ndiaphragm, diagnosis can easily be made with a plain\nchest  x-ray.  But  if  the  injury  consists  of  only  a\nlaceration in the diaphragm, it must be diagnosed by\ndirect  visualization.  In  this  chapter  we  discuss\ndecision making in patients at risk for diaphragmatic\ninjury and surgical planning for patients with acute\nor chronic presentation of diaphragmatic hernia.",
    "Blunt  diaphragmatic  injury  is  caused  by  a\nsudden increase in intra-abdominal pressure, which\nleads to rupture of the diaphragm. This occurs on the\nleft side \u2154 of  the time, where the diaphragm is not\n\u201cprotected\u201d  from  pressure  by  the  liver.  Blunt\ndiaphragmatic  injuries  are  usually  large.  When\nbowel is herniated through the defect, the diagnosis\ncan  be  made  by  seeing  viscera  above  the  left\nhemidiaphragm on imaging.",
    "Penetrating diaphragmatic injury is caused by\na stab or gunshot wound in the \u201cJunctional Region,\u201d\nanywhere between the nipples and the costal margin\nanteriorly,  or  the  tips  of  the  scapula  and  the  costal\nmargins posteriorly. Stab or gunshot wounds in this\nregion  can  also  injure  the  heart,  great  vessels,\nlungs,  or  chest  wall  vessels.  The\nesophagus,\ndiaphragm  defect  is  smaller  than  in  blunt  injury,\nusually the size of the penetrating object. Because of\nthis fact, herniation of viscera is often not present on\npresentation,  making  these  injuries  difficult  to\ndiagnose.  Keep  in  mind  that  a  missile  entering  the\nbody outside the Junctional Region can still cross the\ndiaphragm if its path is tangential enough.\n\nPenetrating injuries inside the \u201cJunctional Region\u201d (Red box)\ncan potentially injure the diaphragm.\n\nAnatomy:",

Innervation is by  the right\nand left phrenic nerves, which begin at the C3, 4, and\n5 nerve roots, run anterior to the scalene muscles in\nthe neck and on the lateral surface of the pericardium\nin the chest, and insert into the central portion of the\ndiaphragm.  Anterior  and  posterior  branches  of  the\nphrenic  nerve  then  spread  through  the  diaphragm,\nrunning parallel to the ribs about 5cm from them.

    "In the more likely case where you do not have\nlaparoscopy available, you face a difficult situation.\nA  hole  in  the  diaphragm  may  not  have  abdominal\ncontents herniated through it at the time, but it almost\ncertainly will if you do not repair it. As always, you\nmust  rely  on  your  own  clinical  reasoning  to  detect\nsuch an injury.\n\nElements  of  the  history  that  you  should\nemphasize include pulmonary symptoms, including\nany dyspnea or cough. The patient\u2019s recollection of\nthe event may provide important clues: how long was\nthe  knife?  Were  they  stabbed  in  an  upward  or\ndownward motion?",
    "Physical examination on  its own  is unlikely\nto  detect  a  diaphragm  injury  without  visceral\nherniation.  However,  adjunct  investigations  can  be\nquite helpful. In a patient with an isolated abdominal\nstab wound, there should be absolutely no fluid in the\nchest. If  any  is seen  at  chest ultrasound or chest x-\nray,  diaphragm  injury  is  very  likely-  a  laparotomy\nand careful inspection of the diaphragm is justified.\n\nis\n\ninjuries,  our  goal\n\nAs we discuss in the chapter on penetrating\nto  perform\nabdominal\nlaparotomy on patients who need it, and to avoid it\non  those  who  do  not.  In  a  patient  with  penetrating\ntrauma who does not otherwise need laparotomy, a\nclinical  scenario  which  puts  them  at  risk  for\ndiaphragm injury is usually enough reason to explore\nthe abdomen.\n\nAvoiding Missed Injuries",
    "Avoiding Missed Injuries\n\nBlunt diaphragm injury is one reason why all\nblunt trauma patients should undergo a chest x-ray.\nAt  times  it  can  be  difficult  to  distinguish  between\nhemo-pneumothorax and herniated viscera above the\ndiaphragm. If you see an air collection that is circular\nor  spherical,  especially  on  the  left  side,  consider\ndiaphragm injury. As described above, a nasogastric\ntube  whose  tip  is  above  the  diaphragm  makes  the\ndiagnosis (though absence of this sign does not rule\nit out.)",
    "One  final  point  is  worth  mentioning:  you\nshould  get  in  the  habit  of  exploring  the  diaphragm\nvery  thoroughly  in  every  laparotomy  you  perform.\nOn the right side, look carefully next to the liver and\nespecially  posterolaterally,  an  area  that  can  be\ndifficult to see. On the left side, make sure you see\nposteriorly  all  the  way  to  the  retroperitoneum  and\nGerota\u2019s fascia, the fatty covering of the left kidney.\nTo  inspect  this  area  properly,  you  must  have  good\nlighting, good exposure with a strong assistant, and\nan incision that extends up to one side of the xiphoid.\nIf there are adhesions in this area, you must take them\ndown  until  you  have  seen  all  the  diaphragm\u2019s\nsurface.\n\nConclusion:",
    "Conclusion:\n\nDiaphragm  injuries  are  much  more  easily\ntreated  in  the  acute  phase  rather  than  late.  Patients\nwhose diaphragm ruptures because of blunt trauma\nwill usually have bowel contents in the chest; this is\neasily  diagnosed  by  plain  chest  x-ray.

At  other  times,  the  two\nworking trocars will be next to each other with  the\ncamera opposite.\n\nIntroduction:",

We\nwill divide these factors into those that are internal to\nthe offending organism and factors that are external\nto the offending organism.\n\nFactors internal to the organism\n\neradicate,\n\nto  consider",

Each  type  of  organism  has  a  varying\nlevel of susceptibility to destruction, which is related\nto its physical structure (i.e lipid envelope or protein\ncapsid). For  example, spores are generally resistant\nto  most  disinfectants  while  mycobacteria  are\ngenerally resistant to alcohol, and prions are resistant\nto heat at 200 oC for as long as two hours.",
    "Organism quantity: Just as microbes grow at\nan  exponential  rate,  microbes  also  die  at  an\nexponential  rate.   As  the  number  of  organisms\nincreases,  a  longer  exposure  time  is  required  to\nachieve disinfection or sterility. Proper cleaning with\nwater and detergent or enzymatic cleansers prior to\ndisinfection  or  sterilization  can  help  to  reduce  the\nmicrobial load and increase the effectiveness of the\ndisinfectant or sterilant.\n\nMost  bacteria  create  a  biofilm  on  solid\norganic  or  inorganic  surfaces  when  the  number  of\norganisms  reaches  a  certain  level.  The  biofilms\ncontain  an  extracellular  matrix  of  proteins  and\npolysaccharides  that  encourage  binding  of  more",
    "bacteria  both  to  the  matrix  and  to  each  other,\nproviding\nstability,  nutrition,  and  protection.\nBiofilms  are  known  to  significantly  decrease  the\nthrough\neffectiveness  of  antimicrobial  agents\ndifferent  adaptations  that  shield  one  another   from\nthe toxic effects of the disinfectant, slow disinfectant\npenetration,  and  even  prevent  antimicrobial  agents\nfrom reaching bacteria at the center of the biofilm, all\nof which prevent sterility from being achieved.\n\nFactors external to the organism",
    "Factors external to the organism\n\nSurface  factors:  Smooth  surfaces  are  easier\nto  disinfect  while  objects  with  rough  surfaces  are\nmore  difficult  because  of  the  microscopic  crevices\nthat  can  house  microorganisms.   In  addition,  the\norganic load \u2013 the presence of organic material like\nblood or tissue \u2013 inhibits the action of disinfectants.\nA  high  organic  load  can   block  neutralizing  agents\nfrom reaching the surface, and biomaterial itself can\neven  inactivate  agents  such  as  bleach.  Proper\ncleaning  with  water  and  detergent  or  enzymatic\ncleaners  prior  to  disinfection  or  sterilization  can\nreduce\nthe\neffectiveness  of\nthe  disinfectant  or  sterilant.\nSimilarly,  biofilms  created  by  certain  organisms\nprevent  agent  contact  with  the  organism  itself,\nthereby requiring both a longer contact time overall,\nas well as higher agent concentration.\n\nthe  organic\n\nload  and\n\nincrease",
    "the  organic\n\nload  and\n\nincrease\n\nAgent  factors:  The  concentration  of  the\ndisinfecting agent is an important factor to consider\nwhen  attempting  disinfection  or  sterilization,  as\nhigher  concentrations  of  a  chemical  agent  do  NOT\nalways  increase  the  microbial  death  rate.  For\nexample,  a  70%  isopropyl  alcohol  solution  can  kill\nmicroorganisms  in  seconds  because  water  both\nallows  the  isopropyl  alcohol  to  enter  and  penetrate\nthe entire cell  and increases the  contact time of  the\ndisinfectant  on  the  surface  by  slowing  the  rate  of\nevaporation  of  the  isopropyl  alcohol.  Conversely,\nsolutions with concentrations above 91% are not as\neffective  because  the  alcohol\u2019s  action  on  the  outer\nlayer  of  microbes  creates  a  protective  layer  of\ndenatured  proteins,  which  actually  shields  other\nproteins  from  becoming  denatured.

However,\nafter two minutes, one million bacterial cells will still\nbe alive because this agent is known to kill 90% of\nthe  bacterial  cells\nin  one  minute.  Therefore,\nsterilization, which requires eradication of all living\ncells, viruses, and spores, can be achieved by certain\nagents  by  increasing  the  duration  of  sterilization  to\nseveral  D-values  longer  than  the  time  needed  to\ntheoretically  reduce  the  microbial  population  down\nto  one  cell.

They  might  even  be\ndischarged from the hospital.\n\nThe classic scenario where poor blood supply\ncan  lead  to  a  late  leak  is  a  left  colon  resection  and\nanastomosis  in  the  left  transverse  colon,  in  the\n\u201cwatershed\u201d  area  between  the  superior  and  inferior\nmesenteric  arteries.

But  after  a  large  elective\nsurgery\nsuch  as  gastrectomy  or  colectomy,\ntachycardia  should  not  be  present  on  the  first\npostoperative  day.  If  it  is,  determine  whether  the\npatient\u2019s  pain  is  adequately  controlled.  If  pain  is\ncontrolled, give a fluid bolus and monitor the heart\nrate  response.

Carefully  assess  the  patient\u2019s  other\nparameters:  measure  their  radial  pulse  yourself  and\nassess the respiratory rate. If both are elevated, or if\nthere is fever, this warrants further investigation. The\nfirst step is to talk to  the patient. Have  they passed\nflatus  yet?  Are  they  having  difficulty  urinating?\nHave  they  ambulated?  Do  they  have  a  cough  or\nshortness  of  breath?  Then,  do  a  thorough  physical\nexam  checking  for  crackles  in  the  lungs  or  any\ntenderness anywhere, including the calves.

Nevertheless, most surgical training programs\ndo  not  overtly  supply  \u201cleadership  training.\u201d  For\nexample, the first chapter of Schwartz\u2019s Principles of\nSurgery  is  \u201cFundamental  Principles  of  Leadership\nTraining  in  Surgery.\u201d  During  our  residency\u2019s  two-\nyear  cycle  through  the  textbook,  this  chapter  was\nnever scheduled for study, even though almost every\nthe  book  (\u201cWound  Healing,\u201d\nother\n\u201cPancreas,\u201d  \u201cTrauma,\u201d  etc.)  was  discussed  several\ntimes.\n\ntopic\n\nin",
    "topic\n\nin\n\nAt  the  end  of  a  surgeon\u2019s  training,  the\nsurgeon  is  automatically  placed  in  the  role  of  a\nleader,  whether  or  not  they  have  acquired  any\nleadership  skills  along  the  way.  The  surgeon\u2019s\nsuccess, and the fate of their patients, will depend on\ntheir ability to lead others. Surgical practice can not\nbe separated from leadership.\n\nThere  are  many  different  definitions  of\n\nleadership. All of the following are appropriate:\n\u25cf  The capability, natural or acquired, to guide, or\ninfluence  a  group  towards  the  realization  of  a\ngoal\n\n\u25cf  The ability to persuade and help others develop\nfuture  visions  and  to  motivate  subordinates  to\ndesire to achieve visions.\n\n\u25cf  The possession of the human factor that binds a\ntowards\ntogether  and  motivates\n\nit\n\ngroup\nachieving goals",
    "\u25cf  The possession of the human factor that binds a\ntowards\ntogether  and  motivates\n\nit\n\ngroup\nachieving goals\n\nBeing placed in a position of leadership does\nnot  imply  that  you  are  a  \u201cleader.\u201d  Being  a  leader\nshould  be  more  than  the  desire  to  be  seen  \u201cabove\u201d\nothers.  Rather,  leadership  is  an  obligation  or  a\nchallenge one feels to fulfill the related desires of the\npeople  in  one\u2019s  circle  of  associates  and  beyond.  It\nfollows from this observation that the best leaders are\noften  not  those  who  first  seek  out  the  role.  Often\nleaders with the greatest influence take up the mantle\nof  leadership  not  out  of  personal  ambition,  but\nbecause they believe in the values of the organization\nand want to see them carried on.\n\nSurgery as a field requires more than just one\nsurgeon\u2019s  skills:  the  clinic,  the  ward,  and  the\n\nitself  all  have  complex",

A  surgeon  contracts  with  the\npatient to successfully shepherd (lead) them through\nthe process of surgical care safely: This contract can\nbe made in seconds in  the Casualty Department, or\nover  painstaking  months  of  clinic  visits.  But  once\nthis  contract  is  made,  the  surgeon  is  placed  in  a\nposition of leadership.",
    "The  surgeon  leader\u2019s  position  can  be  an\nawkward one: the patient\u2019s care will depend on the\nactions  of  myriad  scrub  techs,  anesthetists,  nurses,\nphysiotherapists,  and  other  professionals  including\nother  physicians.  The  surgeon  is  not  the  \u201cboss\u201d  of\nany  of  these  people;  there  is  no  military-like\n\u201ccommand structure\u201d that allows the surgeon to give\norders and expect them to be obeyed. The leadership\nskills  that  are  called  for  here  are  more  subtle,  and\nmore difficult to master.\n\nCommonly  cited  fundamentals  of  good\n\nleadership include the following:\n\u25cf  Self-awareness\n\u25cf  Self-control\n\u25cf  Understanding others\n\u25cf  Managing others",

Finally,\nmanaging  others  can  only  be  done  well  when  the\nother three qualities are achieved.\n\nSelf-Awareness\n\nThe  ability  to  know  and  monitor  your  own\nemotions  and  reactions  is  a  fundamental  skill  of\nleadership.  It  means  you  know  your  values,  your\npersonality, your habits, and how they all affect you.\nCultivate  the  ability  to  look  deep  into  yourself,  to\nunderstand  your  strengths,  your  weaknesses,  your\ntriggers  and  motivators,  as  well  as  how  all  these\naffect or dictate your actions and  reactions to others\naround you.",

People  who  cultivate\nthese  abilities  are  usually  able  to  communicate\neffectively, a trait we will explore more below.",
    "With  self-awareness  comes  humility.  Being\nself-aware,  especially  about  your  strengths  and\nshortcomings, gives the ability to remain humble and\nwilling  to  learn.  Admitting  when  you  are  mistaken\nand showing genuine desire to learn is an act of great\ncourage and humility, and thus defines a great leader\nHumility  may  at  first  seem  similar  to\ntimidity.  But  more  correctly,  humility  is  the  exact\nopposite  of  timidity.  As  a  general  rule,  every  team\nmember  wants  a  confident  leader,  but  almost\neveryone also appreciates a humble one. It has been\nsaid that humility is a virtue, but timidity is a disease.\nAnyone who has to work with you, as subordinate or\nsuperior, will be disappointed if they see the lack of\ncourage and confidence from you as a leader. Thus,\ntimidity will defeat your attempts at  leadership. On\nthe other hand, if you are humble enough to interact\nand listen, if you are humble enough to admit when",
    "timidity will defeat your attempts at  leadership. On\nthe other hand, if you are humble enough to interact\nand listen, if you are humble enough to admit when\ncorrected even by your \u201csubordinates,\u201d you are more\nlikely to be supported and your wishes heeded.",
    "This  principle  is  most  evident  in  those\nsituations,  described  above,  where  you  must  lead\npeople who are not your direct subordinates. The best\nexample  is  your  relationship  with  the  anesthesia\nstaff. If you are timid, you will be pushed around. If\nyou  are  overbearing,  you  will  be  ignored  and\nresisted,  either  actively  or  passively.  Neither\nsituation is best for the patient, or for your own job\nsatisfaction.  But  if  you  can  be  simultaneously\nhumble and sure of yourself, you will be most likely\nto  have  a  collegial  and  supportive  relationship,  to\nyour own benefit and the patient\u2019s.\n\nThere are various ways to improve your self-\nawareness  \u2013  be  open-minded,  think  through  your\nactions of the day, write down your desired plan and\ntrack your progress, have a circle of  trusted friends\nand give them the independence to criticize you.",
    "Adaptability  is  the  bridge  between  self-\nawareness  and  self-control.  You  must  be  able  to\nchange your behavior as the situation changes. The\nexpectations  on  surgeons  and  surgical  trainees  is\n\nenormous,  and  the  outcome  of  a  leader\u2019s  plans  are\nnot always as desired. What makes a surgical leader\nstand out is the ability to see every opportunity as one\nto learn from.\n\nSelf-Control\n\nThis is the ability to resist impulses, maintain\nfocus, and strive to see projects to completion. The\nwillpower to persistently dedicate your attention to a\ntask or project to a satisfactory end is self discipline.\nThis important trait has several facets:\n\nReliability",
    "Reliability\n\nDoing  what  you  say  you  will,  being\ndependable,  is  key  to  high  performance  leadership.\nAs  a  leader  it\u2019s  upon  you  to  set  a  positive  tone  for\ndesirable  and  acceptable  behaviors-  your  example,\npositive  or  negative,  will  set  the  tone  for  everyone\nelse.  You  owe  it  to  yourself  and  the  team  to  be\ntrustworthy and reliable. Your co-workers or people\nyou  lead  should  be  able  to  count  on  you  to  take\ninitiative,  meet  deadlines,  handle  important  details,\nand follow through with decisions you led in making,\nto communicate and to work well with them.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning, at this point, that\nif you are reliable and those around you are not, they\nmay be following someone else\u2019s leadership in this\narea.  This  is  part  of  the  culture  of  a  workplace,  a\nsubject we explore in the chapter Culture Change. It\nis enough to mention here that changing a culture is\none of the supreme tests of a leader.\n\nControl of Emotions",

A  positive\nattitude in a leader encourages a positive attitude in\neveryone else.\n\nDisciplined Experience",
    "Disciplined Experience\n\nThis trait  is one  that you can\u2019t  \u201cfake\u201d when\nyou need it. Like an athlete, your performance at any\nmoment  will  depend  on  your  previous  experience\nand training. Quite simply, a good leader understands\nthe domain they are leading others in, because they\nhave done the work and have the experience. What\nthis  means,  of  course,  is  that  a  surgeon  becomes  a\nbetter leader as they accumulate more experience. So\nmake the most of the experience you have: prepare\nfor it, learn from it, and reflect on it afterwards. The\nrelevant saying here (attributed to various authors) is\n\u201cGood judgment comes from experience. Experience\ncomes from bad judgment.\u201d An experienced surgeon\nhas the judgment to lead others into territory where\nthey themselves have been in before.\n\nUnderstanding Others",
    "Understanding Others\n\nThis trait is a product and a natural result of\nunderstanding yourself. There is no  leader with  the\ngood  fortune  of  leading  only  people  with  the  same\ncharacteristics and behaviors. Thus it is important for\nthe leader to try to understand all of the team, their\nstrengths and weaknesses, and especially the ways in\nwhich  these  strengths  and  weaknesses  are  different\nfrom the leader\u2019s own strengths and weaknesses.\n\nPaying Attention",
    "Paying Attention\n\nIn order to understand others, you must first\nbelieve  that  it  is  necessary  to  do  so.  Please  let  us\nremind  you  that  it  is.  You  will  not  be  an  effective\nleader if you do not make the time and the effort to\nunderstand  the  motivations,  hopes,  fears,  and  even\nthe little \u201cquirks\u201d that make up the people you lead.\nis\nYes,  you  must  know  whether  someone\ntrustworthy,  or  whether  they  have  the  skills  they\nclaim  that  they  do.  But  even  more,  when  you\nunderstand  someone\u2019s  strengths,  you  can  use  these\nstrengths  to  the  advantage  of  the  team  and  your\nmission. A team member whose strengths are known,\n\nvalued, and used will enjoy being part of the team,\nand the whole team will be better because of it.\n\nEmpathy\n\nIn  psychology,  empathy",
    "valued, and used will enjoy being part of the team,\nand the whole team will be better because of it.\n\nEmpathy\n\nIn  psychology,  empathy\n\nis  defined  as\n\u201cunderstanding  another  person\u2019s  experience  by\nimaging  oneself  in  that  other  person\u2019s  situation.\u201d\nEmotional intelligence is a strong foundation for this\ncharacteristic,  and  when  a  leader  has  it,  they  build\nstronger  relationships  with\nteam.  Surgical\nleadership,  especially  when  leading  trainees  from\ndifferent  backgrounds,  requires  identifying  with\nthem and their points of view. Be very slow to judge\nthem or their ideas, but recognize their emotions.\n\nthe\n\nKindness\n\nMany  leaders  would  advise  keeping  some\n\u201cdistance\u201d  between  yourself  and  those  you  lead.\nOthers think this is nonsense. But however you feel\nabout this advice, remember to be kind to those you\nare  leading.  Consider  the  following  story  from  a\nyoung surgeon:",
    "\u201cI  went  to  the  Operating  Theater  around\n4AM one morning to sort out an urgent case. There,\nI  met  the  single  scrub  team  just  finishing  a  case,\nabout to take their first break all night. I told them\nabout the patient. but also told them that given the\ncircumstances, we would do this operation  first on\nthe morning list rather than immediately. They saw\nthat as an act of kindness and never forgot it. Even\nothers  who  only  heard  about  it  were  thankful,  and\nhave  offered  their  services  anytime  I  enter  the\noperating theater, even if not for a case.\u201d",
    "This surgeon brought together several of the\ntraits we have discussed so far. He had control of his\nemotions- although he was concerned for his patient,\nhe  did  not  let  this  feeling  overwhelm  him  at  the\nexpense  of  other  considerations.  He  had\nthe\ndisciplined experience to know that the patient could\nsafely  be  managed  with  a  3-4  hour  delay.  He  was\npaying attention to the state of the Operating Theater\nstaff.  This  allowed  him  to  act  with  empathy  and\nkindness, safely managing all of the resources under\nhis care and  making some valuable  allies along  the\nway.\n\nOPEN MANUAL OF SURGERY IN RESOURCE-LIMITED SETTINGS\nwww.vumc.org/global-surgical-atlas\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License\n\n\fBecoming a Leader During Training and Beyond\nDimingo Gomez, Richard Davis, Holly P.

They  cannot  \u201cshow\nweakness.\u201d  In  this  way  of  thinking,  failure  to\nimmediately  know  what  to  do-  in  every  possible\nsituation- is a form of weakness.\n\nClearly, this wrong approach puts appearance\nover function. Such a leader is more concerned with\n\u201clooking\u201d  like  a  leader  than  with  making  the  right\ndecision. This is a failure of self-control.  There  are\ntwo key attitudes to take to avoid this trap:\n\nFirst  of  all,\n\nto  recognize  which\nlearn\ndecisions must be made urgently and which can wait.\nA  good  leader  appreciates  having  time  to  find  the\nsolution to a  complex problem and does not  let  the\n\u201cfelt urgency\u201d of others push him to act rashly.

If you believe that this behavior\nis  a  sign  of  weakness,  consider  the  number  of\nsuccessful leaders who were known to have an \u201cinner\ncircle\u201d of advisors. This is a very common practice.\nAt first it may set you apart, especially in a culture\nthat expects leaders to work alone.

It\ncan be the devastating consequence of a single lapse\nin judgment during a long, tedious operation, either\nby yourself or another surgeon.",
    "The  three  stages  of  fistula  management  are\nclassically  described  as  resuscitation  and  infection\ncontrol,  investigation,  and  intervention.  In  this\nchapter, we will focus on the latter  two stages, and\nthe difficult management decisions and strategies to\nget  you  to  a  successful  result.  Regarding  the  first\nstage,  remember  that  a  leaking  intestine  inside  the\nabdomen will leak into the peritoneum before finding\nits way to the skin. Sepsis control consists of draining\nthe peritoneum and assuring a consistent exit of the\nleakage.  Usually  this  will  involve  re-opening  the\nabdominal  incision,  or  making  a  new  opening  over\nthe leaking site, and not closing it. This results in the\ndreaded \u201copen abdomen.\u201d We discuss this entity here\nas well.",

Although\nthis  approach  might  be  needed  with  very  proximal\nfistulas, in most situations there are other options that\ncost less money and allow a patient to experience the\njoy  of  eating.  In  any  event,  in  a  resource-limited\nsetting,  prolonged  hospitalization  and  parenteral\nnutrition are not realistic options.",
    "The lateral abdominal wall muscles originate\nat the posterior aspect of the abdominal cavity, along\nthe  lumbodorsal  fascia  and  other  midline  posterior\nstructures.  They  insert  into  the  lateral  aspect  of  the\nrectus sheath on each side. If the two rectus sheaths\nare  separated,  as  in  open  abdomen,  the  lateral\nabdominal  wall  muscles  will  retract.  After  about  7\nthe\ndays,  this  retraction\nabdominal incision can not be closed again without\nmeasures such as components separation.\n\nis  so  extensive  that\n\nWhen the linea alba, between the two rectus muscles (Straight\ndotted line) is divided, the lateral abdominal wall muscles begin\nto contract, unopposed, towards their origin (Purple arrows.)\nIf this contraction is allowed to persist for more than 7 days, it\nmay  be  impossible  to  reapproximate  the  linea  alba  at  the\nmidline. An \u201copen abdomen\u201d is usually the result.",
    "Within  the  abdominal  cavity,  any  sort  of\nintervention leads to severe inflammation. Especially\nif there is spillage of enteric contents or of purulent\nmaterial, this inflammation can be significant. As a\ngeneral  rule  of  thumb,  if  the  patient  had  an\nuncomplicated  laparotomy,  you  should  not  attempt\nto operate in their abdomen during the time period of\n2-6  weeks  after  surgery.  If  there  was  spillage  of\nsuccus  or  infection,  do  not  operate  for  at  least  3\nmonths:  6  months  would  be  preferable.  Failure  to\nheed these  timelines leads to  a difficult  and bloody\noperation that has a very high chance of causing an\ninadvertent enterotomy.\n\nIf  you  are  operating  on  a  patient  with\nintra-abdominal\nmalnutrition\ncontamination,  it  is  best  to  avoid  any  bowel\nanastomosis or suture if possible.

But the surgeon should also\ndo  their  best  to  prevent  this  fluid  from  coming  in\ncontact with the skin. Once the skin is irritated, it will\nbe painful to the patient and much more difficult to\napply  dressings  or  ostomy  appliances  to.

    "Compartment Syndromes and Fasciotomies of the Extremities\nMark W. Bowyer\n\nIntroduction:\n\nAll surgeons caring for patients with trauma\nto  the  extremities,  or  practicing  vascular  surgery\nmust  be  able  to  recognize  and  surgically  treat\ncompartment  syndromes.  This  entity  results  from  a\nvariety  of  causes.  The  final  outcome  is  increased\ncompartment  pressure  that  exceeds  the  arterial\ninflow, with resultant ischemia and necrosis. Failure\nto  identify  and  treat  compartment  syndromes  in  a\ntimely  fashion  leads  to  preventable  morbidity  and\nmortality, and is a common source of litigation. The\ndiagnosis  of  compartment  syndrome  is  largely\nclinical, but measurement of compartment pressures\nmay be useful in patients with equivocal findings or\naltered  level  of  consciousness.  The  below-  knee\nlower  extremity\nis  most  commonly  affected,\nfollowed much less frequently, by the forearm, thigh,\nbuttock, foot and hand\n\nPathophysiology/Epidemiology:",
    "Pathophysiology/Epidemiology:\n\nCompartment  syndrome  has  been  found\nwherever  a  compartment  is  present:  hand,  forearm,\nupper  arm,  abdomen,  buttock  and  the  entire  lower\nextremity.  The  pathophysiology  of  compartment\nsyndrome  is  relatively  straightforward.  Groups  of\nmuscles and their associated nerves and vessels are\nsurrounded  by  thick  fascial  layers  that  define  the\nvarious  compartments  of  the  extremities.  These\ncompartments are of relatively fixed volume, as the\nfascial  layers  are  unable  to  expand.  Compartment\nsyndrome  occurs  either  when  compartment  size  is\nrestricted or compartment volume is increased. This\ncan  occur  because  of  fractures,  vascular  injuries,\nelectrical  burns,  blast  injuries,  crush  injuries,  too\ntight  casts of splints, or tissue  trauma after fracture\nreduction.",
    "As  the  pressure  within  the  compartment\n(from  blood,  fluid,  or  external  pressure)  increases,\nthe\ntissue  perfusion  decreases  and  cellular\nmetabolism is impaired, leading to cellular death. If\nthis  pressure  is  not  relieved  in  a  timely  fashion,\nirreversible  damage  will  occur.  The  usually  quoted\ntime is 4 to 6 hours, but it may be as little as an hour\nfor  a  patient  in  shock.  Polytrauma  patients  with\nhypotension can sustain irreversible  injury at lower\ncompartment  pressures  than  normotensive  patients,\n\nand  a  very  high  index  of  suspicion  should  be\nmaintained in this group.",
    "and  a  very  high  index  of  suspicion  should  be\nmaintained in this group.\n\nThe  leg  (calf)  is  the  area  that  is  most\ncommonly  affected,  accounting  for  68%  in  a  large\ncivilian  series  (Branco),  followed  by  the  forearm\n(14%),  and  the  thigh  (9%).  In  a  review  of  294\ncombat-injured\n494\nfasciotomies, Ritenour  et al reported  the calf as the\nmost  common  site  (51%)  followed  by  the  forearm\n(22%), thigh (8%), upper arm (7%), hand (6%), and\nthe foot (5%).\n\nundergoing\n\nsoldiers",

Additionally,  the  need  for  fasciotomy  was\nrelated to the type of injury, ranging from 2.2% for\npatients  with  closed  fractures  to  41.8%  in  patients\nwith  combined  venous  and  arterial  injuries.

The  classically  described  five\n\u201cPs\u201d  \u2013  pain,  pallor,  paresthesia,  paralysis,  and\npulselessness \u2013 are pathognomonic of compartment\nsyndrome.

It can\nbe tamed pre-operatively through nutritional support.\nPreoperative  nutrition  support  optimizes  patient\nnutrition  status,  preparing  the  patient  for  increased\nmetabolic demands due to surgical injury.\n\nUnder  normal  conditions,  fatty  acids  are\nmobilized in states of starvation, in a process called\nketosis. Infection and injury inhibit this response and\ninstead  cause  the  mobilization  of  muscle  protein.\nThis process leads to generalized muscle weakness,\nedema,  and  weight  loss.  Severe  malnutrition  can\nweaken  the  respiratory  muscle,  making  the  patient\nunable  to  cough  effectively  which  promotes  chest\ninfection  and  atelectasis.  The  immune  response  to\ninfection  also  becomes  down-regulated  and  T-cell,\nB-cell and macrophage function deteriorates.",

This  is\ndefined as negative balance of 100g of nitrogen and\n10,000kcals of  energy within a few days. Nutrition\nintervention is achieved through accurate estimation\nof  energy  requirements  and  provision  of  available\nfood.\n\nEnergy Requirements:\n\nrequirements",
    "Energy Requirements:\n\nrequirements\n\nThe  standard  approach  used  is  to  estimate\nenergy\nthe  basal  energy\nfrom\nexpenditure  accompanied  by  the  stress  factors.\nEnergy  is  provided  by  carbohydrate  and  fat,  while\nprotein  is  used  to  compete  with  the  metabolic\nresponse of the body to trauma.\n\nIn  sepsis,  there  will  be  increased  protein\nbreakdown. The body utilizes lipid more easily than\nglucose,\nis  associated  with\nhyperglycaemia (septic diabetes.)\n\ntherefore  sepsis\n\nTypical adult surgical patients need 1800 to\n2500kcal/day.  The  average  daily  requirement,  in\nseriously  ill  patients,  is  25  -  30  kcal/kg/day.\nRegarding  protein  requirement,  6.25  gm  of  protein\nprovides  1  gm  of  nitrogen.  Daily  nitrogen\nrequirement is 0.2 grams/kg.",
    "Typically, energy is given to the patient in the\nfollowing distributions: carbohydrate 50%, fat 35%,\nprotein  15%.  One  gram  of  carbohydrate  provides\n4kcal, 1gram of protein provide 4kcal, while 1gm of\nfat  provide  9  kcal.  These  energy  sources  must  be\ndelivered  in  combination  with  fluid,  electrolytes,\nvitamins  and  trace  elements.  Fluid  requirement  is\ntypically  30-35ml/kg/day.  Major  electrolytes  like\nNa, K, and Cl requirement are 1.0 mmol/kg/day each.\nZinc, Magnesium, and Phosphorus are the main trace\nelements required in daily diet.\n\nThe  Harris-Benedict  Equation  is  a  common\nmethod  for  calculating  energy  requirements.

    "22. After  initial  surgical  intervention,  the  primary\nfocus  turns  to  prevention  of  secondary  injuries.\nFor  patients  with  severe  traumatic  brain  injury,\ntrauma guidelines recommend a 7 day course of\nprophylactic antiepileptic medication, which can\nhelp  prevent  early  post-traumatic  seizures,\nthough  it  does  not  improve  long-term  outcome.\nSome  surgeons  chose  to  prescribe  a  week  of\nto  patients  with\nprophylactic  antiepileptics\nmoderate traumatic brain injury who underwent\nsurgical  intervention  or  were  found  to  have\nintracranial  hemorrhage.\nto\nand\nappropriate\nmaintaining\nperfusion pressure levels and fluid management,\ncare should be taken when positioning patients,\nespecially\ncomatose  or\nexperiencing motor deficits.

    "padded, and a regular regimen of turning should\nbe  instituted  to  avoid  pressure  wounds.  Special\ncare should be taken to avoid pressure wounds on\nthe posterior of the skull, particularly if the area\nhas  traumatic  lacerations  or  abrasions.  Finally,\nwound  care  should  be  tailored  to  the  incision\nlocation, closure material, and context. A simple\nbandage may be used as barrier protection for the\nfirst 24-48 hours postoperatively, after which the\nincision  may  be  left  to  air  if  the  context  is\nsufficiently clean. Care should be taken to keep\nthe incision clean, dry, and not covered by hair,\nhats, or scarfs, until it is fully healed.",

Follow up times will vary depending on extent of\ninjury and intervention, length of intensive care\nand  hospital  stay,  and  extent  of  persistent\nneurologic  deficit.  At  a  minimum,  a  patient\nshould  be  evaluated  approximately  10-14  days\nafter  surgery  to  ensure  the  incision  is  healing\nappropriately  and  there  are  no  signs  of  early\ninfection.  A  postoperative  CT  scan  is  often  not\nnecessary  in  the  case  of  a  simple  skull  fracture\nrepair but may be desired to evaluate for ongoing\nintraparenchymal  or  subdural\nresolution  of\nhematomas,  particularly  for  those  who  are  not\nneurologically intact.",
    "An  isolated  skull  fracture  typically  presents\nwith minimal symptoms or symptoms of concussion\nand has a good prognosis for recovery after surgical\nrepair.  Prognosis  after  depressed  skull  fracture  is\nlargely  related  to  additional  intracranial  injuries\nand/or  complications  encountered  intraoperatively.\nIn  many  studies,  most  patients  had  good  long-term\noutcomes after a brain injury with a depressed skull\nfracture; however, this is certainly influenced by the\nextent of parenchymal damage and secondary brain\ninjury.  Motor  deficits,  pneumocephalus  on\nadmission CT scan, pre-operative GCS<13, need for\nreoperation,  and  hospitalization  longer  than  3  days\nwere  found  to  be  predictors  of  poor  neurologic\noutcomes in one study. Persistent neurologic deficits\nmay necessitate long-term physical therapy or a stay\nin  an  inpatient  rehabilitation  center  during  the\nrecovery  process.  In  resource-poor  settings,  long-",
    "may necessitate long-term physical therapy or a stay\nin  an  inpatient  rehabilitation  center  during  the\nrecovery  process.  In  resource-poor  settings,  long-\nterm rehabilitation by professionals is out of reach of\nmost families, who find that the burden of care falls\non them. Discussions around these situations can be\nvery difficult and should be led by a member of the\nteam  who  understands  the  needs  and  abilities  of\nfamilies in the local context.",
    "In  addition  to  the  outcomes  related  to  brain\ninjury,  patients  who  undergo  surgical  repair  of\ndepressed skull fracture are at risk for postoperative\ninfection (reported in 4-16% in some case reports),\nseizures (3-12%), and cerebrospinal fluid leak (3%).\n\nPitfalls\n\nFractures traversing the venous sinuses have\nunique  risks.  It  is  recommended  to  get  a  CT\nvenogram,  MRA  or  angiogram  with  venous  flow\nphase  for  adequate  evaluation.  If  these  are  not\navailable, a knowledge of venous sinus anatomy as it\nrelates  to  the  fracture  pattern  is  crucial.  After\nevaluation, the decision to operate on these patients\nis based on the degree of venous flow compromise,\nlocation  of\nthe\nneurological status of the patients. Midline fractures\nover  the  \u201cmotor  cortex\u201d  and  sagittal  sinus  may\npresent  with  ipsilateral  or  bilateral  lower  extremity\n\ninvolvement  and\n\nthe  sinus",

    "Neurologically  stable  patients  with  a  closed\nfracture over a patent venous sinus can be observed.\nIf  the  fracture  is  open,  the  patients  should  undergo\ndebridement without elevation of the bone segment.\nHowever,  neurologically  unstable  patients  or  those\nwith severe deformity may require urgent elevation\nof the depressed bone segment.

If  air\nembolism  is  suspected,  rapidly  flood  the  field  with\nsaline, turn the patient or bed such that the left side\nis down, and move the patient to the Trendelenburg\nposition.",
    "Conclusion:\n\nDepressed skull fractures comprise a variety\nof injuries and  can present as simply  as a  cosmetic\ndeformity in an intact patient or accompany a severe\ntraumatic brain injury. Considerations for operative\nmanagement include whether the fracture is open or\nthere  is  exposed  bone,  the  significance  of  the\ndisplaced  fragments,  the  patient\u2019s  neurologic  status\nand  severity  of  polytrauma,  and  suspicion  or\nconfirmation of additional  intracranial injuries. The\ngoal  of  surgical  management  includes  elevation  of\nthe  fractured  bone  fragments,  evaluation  and\nevacuation of possible subdural injuries, evaluation\nand repair of dural defects, and reconstruction of the\nthe  skull.  Specific\nnormal  round  contour  of\napproaches  to  treatment  and  follow  up  will  depend\non severity of injury and resources available in each\ncontext.",
