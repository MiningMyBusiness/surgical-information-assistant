    "question": "How does the scenario of operating on a patient with an anastomotic leak differ from operating on a young healthy patient with a traumatic small bowel perforation?",
    "answer": "The scenario of operating on a patient with an anastomotic leak is different because even with excellent surgical technique, an anastomotic leak is likely to develop in patients with malnutrition, high levels of contamination, or inflamed and friable bowel, whereas operating on a young healthy patient with a traumatic small bowel perforation does not carry the same high risk of an anastomotic leak."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is an anastomotic leak in the context of bowel surgery for typhoid perforation?",
    "answer": "An anastomotic leak refers to a situation where the connection between two parts of the bowel (constructed during surgery) develops a hole, allowing bowel contents to leak out into the abdomen. This can occur acutely or more delayedly, leading to infections and other complications."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended treatment for an anastomotic leak after typhoid perforation surgery?",
    "answer": "The recommended treatment is to proceed with an ostomy rather than attempting another primary repair, resection, or additional suturing over the leak. An ostomy involves creating an opening in the abdomen to divert bowel contents, allowing time for the leak to heal."
  },
  {
